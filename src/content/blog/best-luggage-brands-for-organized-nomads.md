Away has transformed the luggage game with its sleek, functional designs tailored for modern travelers. Combining style with practicality, their luggage is designed to make packing and traveling easier. Here's a look at their standout features and top models.

### Storage Features

Away luggage offers some clever features to keep you organized. Their signature compression system helps you pack more efficiently, while water-resistant linings and mesh compartments protect your essentials, including electronics. The TSA-approved ejectable USB charger is perfect for keeping your devices powered during long layovers. Other handy touches include removable laundry bags, dual compartments with compression pads to separate clean and worn items, and reinforced exterior pockets for easy access to smaller items.

### Recommended Models

Away has a range of options to suit different needs. Their Carry-On is a popular choice, offering a compact size with a 39.8L capacity, perfect for short trips. If you need more space but still want carry-on convenience, the Bigger Carry-On provides 47.9L and fits in most overhead bins. For longer trips, the Medium model offers a spacious 68.8L capacity.

| Model | Dimensions | Weight | Capacity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carry-On | 21.7" × 13.7" × 9" | 8.1 lbs | 39.8L |
| Bigger Carry-On | 22.7" × 14.7" × 9.6" | 8.4 lbs | 47.9L |
| Medium | 26" × 18.5" × 11" | 9.9 lbs | 68.8L |

### Pros and Cons

The luggage is built with a durable polycarbonate shell, offering protection without adding too much weight. Smooth 360-degree spinner wheels make it easy to maneuver through crowded airports. On the downside, the hard-shell design can be less flexible in tight spaces, and the built-in battery may require occasional upkeep. However, a strong warranty and thoughtful organizational features make the higher price point worth considering.

Picking the right luggage is crucial for digital nomads. As this lifestyle grows in popularity, staying organized while traveling isn't just convenient - it helps maintain both productivity and peace of mind. The right bag can turn a hectic trip into a smooth one.

Your travel habits should guide your decision.

### Personal Travel Needs

| Travel Style | Key Considerations | Suggested Features |

| City Hopper | Easy mobility and size | Spinner wheels, compact and lightweight design |
