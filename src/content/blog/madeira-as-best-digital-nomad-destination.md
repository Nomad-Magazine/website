## Internet and Tech Setup

### Internet Quality and Access

In Madeira, the internet infrastructure is well-suited for digital nomads. Urban areas like Funchal boast fiber optic connections with speeds reaching up to 1 Gbps, while rural areas usually see speeds closer to 30 Mbps [\[11\]](https://wildexpedition.com/connectivity-internet-wifi-phone-in-madeira/). The main providers - [MEO](https://en.meo.pt/), [NOS Madeira](https://www.nos.pt/en/institutional/nos/nos-group/nos-madeira), and Vodafone - offer fiber packages ranging from 200 to 1000 Mbps, priced between €38.99 and €45.99 per month.

| Provider | Coverage | Speed Range | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MEO | 80-90% fiber infrastructure | 200-1000 Mbps | €38.99-€45.99 |
| NOS Madeira | Extensive urban coverage | 200-1000 Mbps | €38.99-€45.99 |
| Vodafone | Urban centers | 200-1000 Mbps | €38.99-€45.99 |

Fernando Mendes advises: _"If you're renting or have just moved to Portugal, I typically recommend that people go with MEO... MEO is the biggest network in terms of size and network availability. It has around 80-90% of the fibre infrastructure"_ [\[10\]](https://www.portugalist.com/internet-madeira).

Free public WiFi is available in many areas, particularly in Funchal, where public spaces often provide reliable connectivity [\[11\]](https://wildexpedition.com/connectivity-internet-wifi-phone-in-madeira/). For coworking spaces, hubs like Homeoffice Madeira deliver speeds exceeding 200 Mbps for downloads and 100 Mbps for uploads. Combined with Madeira's tech support services, staying connected is rarely an issue.

### Power and Tech Support

For tech assistance, [AskWhizz](https://www.askwhizz.com/) offers affordable options:

| Service Level | Cost | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Diagnosis | Free | First problem assessment |
| Monthly Support | €4.99 | Ongoing tech assistance |
| Pay-per-Solution | €9.99 | One-time problem resolution |

If you need hardware repairs or on-site help, local service providers charge approximately €50 per hour for on-site support, €30 for off-site, and €20 for remote assistance (30 minutes) [\[12\]](https://www.techni-call.com/).

Here are some tips to improve your tech setup:

-   Use mobile hotspots to test coverage in different areas.
-   Install WiFi repeaters to tackle connectivity issues in properties with thick walls [\[10\]](https://www.portugalist.com/internet-madeira).
-   Consider bundling your internet with TV and phone services for convenience.
-   Check if your accommodation has fiber internet before committing [\[10\]](https://www.portugalist.com/internet-madeira).

Most internet plans require a two-year contract, but MEO offers a one-year option, which is ideal for shorter stays [\[10\]](https://www.portugalist.com/internet-madeira). Additionally, Madeira's slightly lower VAT rate (22% compared to 23% on mainland Portugal) helps reduce tech service costs [\[10\]](https://www.portugalist.com/internet-madeira).
