### Network Coverage

-   **United Kingdom**: Download speeds of 43.99 Mbps and upload speeds of 7.05 Mbps, with 5G available in urban areas.
-   **Turkey**: Download speeds of 33.10 Mbps and upload speeds of 13.37 Mbps, offering consistent coverage.
-   **Bulgaria**: Download speeds of 62.92 Mbps and upload speeds of 17.48 Mbps in major cities [\[4\]](https://www.techradar.com/pro/jetpac-review).

In Japan, Jetpac partners with [KDDI Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDDI), delivering **3G/4G speeds averaging 45 Mbps for downloads** and **8-10 Mbps for uploads** in cities like Tokyo and Kyoto [\[5\]](https://freakingnomads.com/jetpac-japan-esim-review/). These metrics highlight dependable service in key locations.

### Connection Quality

Jetpac provides stable connections in most urban and suburban areas. However, some users have noted occasional coverage gaps in remote regions [\[4\]](https://www.techradar.com/pro/jetpac-review). The service primarily runs on **3G/4G networks**, with **5G access** available in select metropolitan areas [\[5\]](https://freakingnomads.com/jetpac-japan-esim-review/).

### Extra Perks

Jetpac adds value to its service with additional travel benefits:

-   **SmartDelay**: Automatically grants lounge access vouchers when flights are delayed by more than 60 minutes [\[2\]](https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/jetpac-esim-review/).
-   **Fast Track Security**: Offers discounted security passes at select airports in Europe and China, with savings of up to 53% [\[2\]](https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/jetpac-esim-review/).
-   **VPN Access**: Includes a complimentary 30-day trial of [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/) with every data package [\[2\]](https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/jetpac-esim-review/).

These perks streamline travel and add convenience, making Jetpac an attractive choice for frequent travelers and digital nomads alike.

## 2\. Standard Roaming Options

Traditional roaming services are often pricey and unreliable compared to Jetpac's more budget-friendly and efficient plans.

### Cost Structure

International roaming with traditional carriers usually comes with high fees. Though they offer roaming packages, these often pale in comparison to the more affordable and flexible bundled data plans provided by eSIM providers like Jetpac.

### Network Coverage

Performance with standard roaming can be inconsistent:

-   **Urban areas in the UK**: Average speeds of 56 Mbps
-   **Rural UK**: Speeds drop to 20 Mbps
-   **European cities**: Speeds fluctuate between 120-150 Mbps [\[6\]](https://www.monito.com/en/review/jetpac)

### Connection Quality

Standard roaming often struggles with delays when crossing borders, erratic speeds, and limited access to modern network technologies. For instance, tests in France showed urban speeds as high as 150 Mbps and rural speeds around 140 Mbps [\[6\]](https://www.monito.com/en/review/jetpac). However, these speeds can vary greatly depending on local network conditions and agreements between carriers. This lack of reliability highlights the appeal of Jetpac's more consistent connection options.

### Extra Perks

Traditional roaming services tend to lack the added benefits that eSIM providers offer to travelers. While they may include basic features like customer support, usage monitoring apps, and top-up options, they fall short of delivering the extensive travel benefits that Jetpac integrates into its plans.

Here's a quick comparison of Jetpac eSIM and standard roaming services:

### Limitations

With plans like the Southeast Asia Explorer offering **20GB for $20** [\[1\]](https://freakingnomads.com/jetpac-travel-esim-review/), it's a budget-friendly option for those exploring multiple countries.
