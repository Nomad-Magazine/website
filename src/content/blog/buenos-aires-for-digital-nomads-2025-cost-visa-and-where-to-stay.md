## Getting Started in Buenos Aires

### How to Rent an Apartment

Looking for a place to live in Buenos Aires? Digital tools and local knowledge can make the process easier.

| Platform | Best For | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Mercado Libre](https://www.mercadolibre.com.ar/)** | Long-term rentals | Use the Spanish interface for listings. |
| **Facebook Groups** | Short-term stays | Always visit properties in person. |
| **Local Agencies** | Guaranteed contracts | Be prepared with cash for deposits. |

If you're using **Mercado Libre**, switch to Spanish when sending inquiries. This ensures smoother communication with landlords [\[13\]](https://nickipoststravelstuff.substack.com/p/argentina-101-everything-you-need-to-know-before-coming).

Once you’ve found a place, getting familiar with the local language and customs will help you settle in more comfortably.

### Spanish Skills and Local Customs

Argentine Spanish has its own quirks. The pronunciation and vocabulary are heavily shaped by the country's Italian roots [\[15\]](https://becci.dk/spanish-in-argentina/).

> "Learning the slang unique to Argentina is key if you're planning to converse with the locals in Buenos Aires." - Kristin Dean, LandingPad BA [\[16\]](https://landingpadba.com/helpful-phrases-argentine-spanish/)

Picking up basic Argentine Spanish can help you with day-to-day tasks like shopping, catching public transport, or even chatting with locals.

Cultural tip: Since about 70% of Argentinians have Italian heritage [\[14\]](https://www.fluentin3months.com/spanish-in-argentina/), understanding their unique expressions and traditions will make your experience more enjoyable.

Once you’re comfortable with the language and culture, you’ll also find it easier to navigate Buenos Aires’ healthcare system.

### Medical Care Options
