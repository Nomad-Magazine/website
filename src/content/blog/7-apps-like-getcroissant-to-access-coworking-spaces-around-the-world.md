For example, Workfrom covers over 1,250 cities [\[15\]](https://remote.co/apps-find-a-coworking-space-when-traveling/).

**Budget Considerations**

| Pricing Models | Monthly Cost | Additional Benefits |

After reviewing costs, make sure the app offers the workspace features you require.

**Workspace Requirements**  
For those working remotely, having the right workspace features can make all the difference:

-   **WiFi Quality**: Look for apps that provide detailed internet speed information [\[4\]](https://workfrom.co/).
-   **Noise Levels**: Some apps rate noise levels, helping you choose quieter spaces [\[4\]](https://workfrom.co/).
-   **Power Access**: Check if power outlet availability is listed [\[4\]](https://workfrom.co/).
-   **Meeting Spaces**: If you need meeting rooms, select an app with booking options [\[15\]](https://remote.co/apps-find-a-coworking-space-when-traveling/).

**Professional Features**  
Certain apps offer more than just workspace access. For instance, LiquidSpace supports a range of professional needs, from startups to real estate managers [\[15\]](https://remote.co/apps-find-a-coworking-space-when-traveling/). If you require features like professional meeting rooms or networking opportunities, prioritize apps that include these [\[1\]](https://getcroissant.com/).

**Flexibility and Booking Options**  
Many platforms provide a mix of day passes, monthly memberships, or pay-as-you-go plans. Take advantage of trial periods to see if the app meets your expectations before committing.

**Sustainability and Environment**  
For those who value eco-friendly choices, some apps focus on coworking spaces with sustainable practices or locations close to nature [\[1\]](https://getcroissant.com/). Selecting an app that reflects your values can make remote work even more rewarding.
