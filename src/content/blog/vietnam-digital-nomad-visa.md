Vietnam's vibrant cities, affordable living, and growing digital infrastructure make it a great destination for remote workers, even without a dedicated digital nomad visa.

## Current Visa Types for Remote Workers in Vietnam

Vietnam doesn't currently offer a specific visa for digital nomads. However, there are several visa options that remote workers can use, such as tourist visas, business visas, and the e-visa. Each comes with its own set of benefits and limitations.

### Tourist Visa Overview

A tourist visa is a simple choice for remote workers visiting Vietnam. The **e-visa**, available to citizens of 46 countries, allows a 30-day stay for a fee of $25 USD [\[1\]](https://blog.onwardticket.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa)[\[4\]](https://lawyers-vietnam.com/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa/). For longer stays, the **90-day visa on arrival** is another option.

| Tourist Visa Type | Duration | Total Cost | Processing Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E-visa | 30 days | $25 USD | 3 working days |
| Visa on Arrival | Up to 90 days | $56-100 USD\* | 5-7 working days |

_\*Includes application fee ($6–50) and stamping fee ($50)._

If you're planning an extended stay or need a visa for business purposes, other options may be more suitable.

### Business Visa Details

Business visas are better suited for longer stays and come with added flexibility. These visas typically require sponsorship from a Vietnamese company. The process usually involves:

-   Securing sponsorship from a licensed Vietnamese company [\[5\]](https://www.getvisavietnam.com/vietnam-business-visa/).
    
-   Providing passport details and passport-sized photos.
    
-   Paying fees, which vary depending on the embassy or consulate.
    
-   Waiting about 5–7 working days for approval [\[5\]](https://www.getvisavietnam.com/vietnam-business-visa/).
    

This type of visa is ideal for remote workers with business ties or longer-term plans in Vietnam.

### How to Apply for an E-Visa

The e-visa system is one of the easiest ways to enter Vietnam. Applications are submitted online through the official [Vietnam Immigration](https://www.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/) portal. Key features include:

-   Online application through the official portal.
    
-   Valid entry at 33 checkpoints across the country, including 8 major airports, 16 land border crossings, and 9 seaports.
    
-   Single-entry permission, with no extension options within Vietnam [\[6\]](https://www.vietnam-visa.com/business-visa).
    

For remote workers, the e-visa is a fast and straightforward choice, requiring minimal paperwork. However, if your stay exceeds 30 days, you’ll need to explore other visa options or plan for periodic exits and reapplications.

## Who Can Apply for Vietnam Visas

Vietnam doesn’t currently offer a dedicated digital nomad visa. However, remote workers can apply for various existing visa types depending on their situation. Understanding the requirements is key to a smooth application process and a successful stay in Vietnam.

### Passport Requirements

Your passport needs to remain valid for at least six months beyond your intended entry date into Vietnam [\[1\]](https://blog.onwardticket.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa). If you're applying for an e-visa, you’ll also need to upload a JPG image of the passport's biodata page.

### Financial and Insurance Obligations

While there’s no set income requirement, you’ll need to pay visa fees and have valid health insurance [\[2\]](https://localnomads.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam/). Here’s a breakdown of the costs:

| Type | Details | Cost Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E-visa Fee | Non-refundable application fee | $25 USD [\[1\]](https://blog.onwardticket.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa) |
| Visa on Arrival | Online application fee plus stamping fee | $56–100 USD [\[1\]](https://blog.onwardticket.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa) |
| Health Insurance | Coverage for your stay | Varies by provider [\[2\]](https://localnomads.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam/) |

### Required Documents

Remote workers applying for a Vietnam visa need to prepare the following:

**Primary Documents**:

-   A valid passport with at least six months of validity
    
-   A completed application form
    
-   Two recent passport-sized color photos
    
-   Proof of visa fee payment [\[2\]](https://localnomads.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam/)
    
-   Valid health insurance documentation [\[2\]](https://localnomads.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam/)
    

**Additional Requirements**:

-   Entry and exit form provided during your flight [\[1\]](https://blog.onwardticket.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa)
    
-   English translations for documents not in English or Vietnamese [\[7\]](https://vn.usembassy.gov/required-documents/)
    

For longer stays or multiple entries, you may need extra documentation to show financial stability and detailed travel plans. Organizing these documents ahead of time can simplify both the initial application and any future visa extensions.

## How to Get Your Vietnam Visa

Getting the right visa is key to a smooth remote work experience in Vietnam. There are several visa options tailored to different needs and lengths of stay.

### Choosing the Right Visa

The type of visa you need depends on how long you plan to stay and your work setup:

| Visa Type | Duration | Best For | Perks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visa Exemption | 14–30 days | Short-term visits | No application required |
| E-visa (Single Entry) | 30 days | Short stays | Easy online application |
| E-visa (Multiple Entry) | 90 days | Frequent travelers | Longer validity, online process |
| Visa on Arrival | Up to 90 days | Extended stays | Flexible entry dates |
| Work Visa | Up to 2 years | Long-term employment | Stability for work |

For most remote workers, the **E-visa** is a convenient choice, offering a straightforward online process and a 30-day validity. If you're planning a longer stay, the **Visa on Arrival** is ideal, allowing stays of up to 90 days.

Once you’ve decided on the right visa, follow these steps to complete your application.

### How to Apply

For an **E-visa**, head to the official Vietnam Immigration website. You'll need to upload a passport photo and your passport's data page, provide your temporary address in Vietnam, and pay the required fee [\[3\]](https://esim.holafly.com/visas/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa/).

If opting for a **Visa on Arrival**, apply online for a pre-approval letter. During your flight, fill out the entry/exit form and pay the stamping fee once you arrive in Vietnam [\[1\]](https://blog.onwardticket.com/digital-nomad-visa/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa).

### Fees and Processing Times

| Application Type | Processing Time | Fee | Extra Costs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E-visa (Single Entry) | 3 working days | $25 | None |
| E-visa (Multiple Entry) | 3 working days | $50 | None (valid for 90 days) |
| Visa on Arrival | 2–4 working days | $18–$43 (service fee) | $25–$50 (stamping fee) |

If you're using the Visa on Arrival option, make sure to carry cash for the stamping fee, as it must be paid at the airport.

These practices, combined with proper visa documentation, help ensure a seamless remote work experience in Vietnam.

## Making Your Stay Work

### Extending Your Visa

If you're planning to stay longer in Vietnam, you'll need to navigate the visa process carefully since there's no specific visa for digital nomads.

For e-visa holders, the process involves leaving Vietnam when your visa expires, reapplying, and then re-entering the country. Other visa types can often be renewed more easily with the help of local travel agencies. If you're on a work visa, you have more options, as these permits can last up to two years and are renewable [\[3\]](https://esim.holafly.com/visas/vietnam-digital-nomad-visa/).

While handling visa requirements, it's also a good idea to get familiar with Vietnamese customs to make your daily interactions smoother.

### Local Customs Guide

Understanding Vietnamese norms can help you connect with locals and avoid awkward situations. Here are some key cultural tips:

| Cultural Aspect | Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| **Greetings** | Use "Xin chào" to say hello. |
| **Business Etiquette** | Stay calm and avoid public confrontations. |
| **Dining Protocol** | Wait for elders to start eating and avoid sticking chopsticks upright in rice. |
| **Temple Visits** | Cover your shoulders and knees, and always remove your shoes. |
| **Social Interactions** | Keep public displays of affection to a minimum. |

In both social and business settings, it's important to stay composed and respect the idea of "saving face." This means avoiding actions or words that could embarrass anyone, including yourself [\[12\]](https://sonasia-holiday.com/vietnam-travel/local-etiquette).

### Money and Health Services

Taking care of your finances and health is key to a hassle-free stay in Vietnam.

**Healthcare Access:**  
[Family Medical Practice](https://www.vietnammedicalpractice.com/) is a reliable option, with clinics in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Danang offering a range of medical services [\[14\]](https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/asia/vietnam.php).

**Financial Management:**  
For international banking, platforms like [Wise](https://wise.com/us/) and [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) provide multi-currency accounts, making transactions easier [\[15\]](https://wise.com/us/blog/best-bank-digital-nomads). They also offer better exchange rates compared to traditional methods. When it comes to insurance, consider options like [Cigna Global](https://www.cignaglobal.com/) for long-term coverage [\[13\]](https://www.digitalnomadexchange.com/travel-insurance-vietnam.html).

> "As a digital nomad, you'll need to choose between nomad health insurance (a type of travel insurance) for shorter stays and long-term international health insurance to cover you anywhere in the world, typically for 6+ month stays and travel." - Digital Nomad Exchange Resource Guide [\[13\]](https://www.digitalnomadexchange.com/travel-insurance-vietnam.html)

## Next Steps

To move forward with your plans for Vietnam, use this action plan to stay organized and on track:

| 2 months before | Pick your base: Hanoi, HCMC, Da Nang, or Hoi An | Factor in your work-life balance and budget needs. |
| 1 month before | Arrange health insurance and housing | Make sure your insurance includes emergency evacuation coverage. |

Once your timeline is set, rely on local resources and plan your finances carefully to make your move easier.
