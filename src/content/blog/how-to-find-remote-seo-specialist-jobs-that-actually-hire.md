## Top Platforms for Remote SEO Jobs

Explore multiple avenues to boost your chances of landing remote SEO roles.

### Best Job Boards

Look for job boards that specialize in marketing and SEO roles. For example, Remote.co has a section dedicated to marketing positions, including SEO jobs.

When browsing these platforms, use filters to target SEO-specific roles:

-   Job titles like "SEO Specialist"
-   Remote work options
-   Experience level preferences
-   Full-time or contract positions

Set up saved searches to get alerts for new listings. Pair these boards with freelance sites to find short-term SEO projects.

### Freelance Websites

Freelance platforms are great for securing project-based SEO work. To stand out, create a profile that highlights your expertise by including:

-   Clear descriptions of your services
-   A portfolio with examples of past work
-   Testimonials from clients
-   Certifications relevant to SEO

Showcase measurable results, like increased traffic, better rankings, higher conversions, or revenue growth.

### Direct Company Hiring

Many companies post remote SEO job openings directly on their career pages, offering stable, long-term roles.

Here’s how to improve your chances with direct applications:

-   Research companies with a strong online presence
-   Follow their social media for job announcements
-   Use Google Alerts for keywords like "\[Company Name\] + SEO jobs"

Focus on postings that include clear remote work policies and detailed job descriptions. Be mindful of any location-based restrictions.

To ensure the company's legitimacy, check their LinkedIn profiles, employee reviews, business registrations, and [recent news updates](https://www.nomadgossip.com/live-news).

## Preparing Your Job Application

Once you've identified remote SEO job opportunities, it's time to craft an application that clearly demonstrates your results and expertise.

### SEO Resume Tips

Your resume should focus on measurable SEO accomplishments rather than listing generic responsibilities. Show the impact of your work with specific data:

-   Instead of: "Managed SEO, blog posts, and marketing funnels"  
    Write: "Led strategic content creation that boosted organic traffic by 46% in 3 months and generated $20,000 in monthly recurring revenue" [\[5\]](https://www.theremotenomad.com/blog/the-top-3-ways-to-make-your-resume-stand-out-when-applying-to-remote-jobs).

Highlight your technical skills and familiarity with tools:

-   **Technical Skills**: On-page and off-page SEO, keyword research, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, UX/UI optimization, A/B testing
-   **Tools**: Industry-standard analytics and content tools
-   **Content Management Systems**: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Yoast](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/), [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) [\[4\]](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-write-an-seo-resume)

> "Every resume you write should be tailored to the job and the company, so it is important to do some initial research." - BrainStation® [\[4\]](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-write-an-seo-resume)

### Creating Your Portfolio

A well-organized portfolio is essential for proving your expertise. Many successful SEO professionals use case studies to showcase their results effectively.

**Example - [Victorious](https://victorious.com/)**: Their portfolio includes detailed case studies from various industries, complete with metrics, awards, and client testimonials [\[6\]](https://jaysearch.com/blog/seo-portfolio-examples).

What to include in your portfolio:

-   Specific examples from past projects
-   Before-and-after metrics with percentage improvements
-   Graphs and visual data
-   Client reviews and testimonials
-   Links to live projects [\[6\]](https://jaysearch.com/blog/seo-portfolio-examples)

If you're just starting out, consider working on small projects for free to build your portfolio. Document your process and results thoroughly. Pair your portfolio with a personalized cover letter to give a complete picture of your skills.

### Writing Cover Letters

Keep your cover letter concise - half a page to one page is ideal. Focus on:

-   How you understand the company's needs
-   Skills for remote work, such as self-management and digital communication
-   SEO tools and achievements relevant to the role
-   How you approach problem-solving

Avoid these pitfalls:

-   Listing every job responsibility
-   Making vague promises
-   Writing overly long or unfocused paragraphs [\[7\]](https://www.getcoverletter.com/cover-letter-examples/seo-specialist/)

> "Specificity is better." - Western Carolina University [\[8\]](https://remoteworkjunkie.com/remote-job-cover-letter)

When discussing your SEO experience, focus on tools and measurable results. For instance, explain how you used Ahrefs to find keyword opportunities that improved rankings.

Your resume, portfolio, and cover letter should work together seamlessly. The resume provides the data, the portfolio backs it up with proof, and the cover letter ties it all together by explaining how you can add value to the role.

-   Design a custom banner that reflects your SEO expertise.
-   Write a headline that highlights your SEO skills and remote work experience.
-   List at least 5 relevant skills to improve profile discoverability [\[9\]](https://www.virtualvocations.com/blog/telecommuting-job-search-help/how-to-leverage-linkedin/).

**Networking Tips:**

-   Contribute to LinkedIn's collaborative articles to display your expertise.

> "The whole premise online networking and getting what you want when reaching out to people online is that it really comes down to coming from a place of service first and focusing on building the relationships. Remember, relationships take time. You need to constantly nurture them and be patient." – The Remote Nomad® [\[10\]](https://www.theremotenomad.com/blog/online-networking-how-to-get-what-you-want-when-reaching-out-to-people-online)

Stay active by commenting on discussions, sharing useful tools, offering solutions to SEO challenges, and building connections before you need them.

## Spotting Fake Job Posts

When searching for remote SEO roles, it's just as important to avoid scams as it is to craft a strong application. Scammers are becoming more sophisticated, especially as remote work gains popularity. Before applying, take a moment to confirm the job listing is legitimate by watching for these warning signs.

### Common Scam Signs

Here are some key red flags to look out for in remote SEO job postings:

-   **Unprofessional communication**: Listings riddled with broken English, spelling errors, or inconsistent formatting.
-   **Suspicious email domains**: Emails from generic addresses like `@gmail.com` or `@yahoo.com` instead of official company domains.
-   **Payment requests**: Any demand for fees during the hiring process is a major red flag.
-   **Early personal information requests**: Attempts to collect sensitive details, such as bank account information, at the start of the process.
-   **Unrealistic promises**: Offers advertising "unlimited earning potential" or "quick cash."
-   **Experience mismatches**: Jobs that claim no experience is required for roles needing specific expertise.

| Warning Sign | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Upfront Fees** | Legitimate employers won't charge for background checks or onboarding. |
| **Urgent Pressure** | Scammers often rush applicants to prevent them from verifying details. |
| **Vague Details** | Real job postings clearly outline responsibilities and requirements. |
| **Personal Info** | Reputable companies won’t ask for sensitive data, like banking details, early on. |

### Checking Job Legitimacy

If something feels off, take these steps to confirm the job and company are legitimate:

-   **Research the company**: Search the company name along with terms like "scam" or "review" on Google [\[12\]](https://ibrahimkazeem.medium.com/is-that-remote-job-a-scam-ec233cf919b0).
-   **Verify business presence**: Look up the company's physical address and contact details on their website or business directories [\[13\]](https://www.job-hunt.org/scam-jobs-sniff-test/).
-   **Check professional profiles**: Review the company’s LinkedIn page or their Better Business Bureau profile [\[12\]](https://ibrahimkazeem.medium.com/is-that-remote-job-a-scam-ec233cf919b0).
-   **Confirm email domains**: Make sure all email communications come from the company’s official domain.

> "The recruiter OR the employer's name is required information for you to verify that applying for the job is worth your time." – Susan P. Joyce, Online job search expert [\[13\]](https://www.job-hunt.org/scam-jobs-sniff-test/)

> "If something feels off, it probably is. Don't ignore any doubts just because you really want the job." [\[12\]](https://ibrahimkazeem.medium.com/is-that-remote-job-a-scam-ec233cf919b0)

For instance, in October 2023, a job seeker lost $250 after a supposed "founder" requested payment for a background check and onboarding fees. Once the money was sent, the contact disappeared.

Legitimate remote SEO employers will:

-   Conduct thorough, multi-round interviews
-   Communicate through professional channels
-   Never ask for payment during the hiring process
-   Provide clear and detailed job descriptions
-   Use official corporate email addresses for correspondence

## Job Search Organization

Keeping track of job opportunities and maintaining momentum requires a clear plan. A structured approach ensures you don’t miss leads and increases your chances of landing the right job. This method works hand-in-hand with the application strategies covered earlier.

### Job Alert Setup

Setting up job alerts saves time by delivering relevant opportunities straight to your inbox, so you don’t have to manually search multiple platforms every day.

| Platform | Key Alert Features | Suggested Filters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn | Boolean search operators | "SEO Specialist" AND "Remote" |
| Indeed | Location filtering | "Remote" or "Work from home" |
| Simply Hired | Industry filters | "Digital Marketing" + "SEO" |
| Google for Jobs | Customizable radius | "Anywhere" or "United States" |

To make job alerts work for you:

-   Use specific job titles like _"SEO Specialist,"_ _"SEO Manager,"_ or _"SEO Strategist."_
-   Include tools and skills in your filters, such as _"Ahrefs,"_ _"Semrush,"_ or _"Google Analytics."_
-   Set alerts to deliver daily if you’re actively searching, or weekly if you’re monitoring passively.
-   Opt for notifications for both full-time and contract roles.

> "Job alerts are a powerful tool for streamlining your job search. They bring opportunities directly to your inbox, saving you time and ensuring you are aware of openings that match your goals." - Tracy Shroyer, PhD [\[14\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-tips-set-up-effective-job-search-alerts-tracy-shroyer-phd-xhllc)

### Application Tracking

Use a tracking system to stay organized with your applications and follow-ups. A simple spreadsheet or a project management tool can help you manage deadlines, interviews, and other key details.

Here’s what to track:

-   Company name and job title
-   Date the application was submitted
-   Follow-up deadlines
-   Interview dates and stages
-   Contact details of hiring managers
-   Materials submitted (e.g., resume, cover letter)
-   Current application status

To stay prepared, maintain a digital portfolio that includes:

-   Copies of tailored resumes and any research notes
-   Records of salary discussions
-   Interview feedback logs
-   Work samples or portfolios

Update your tracker frequently to meet deadlines and schedule follow-ups. Use calendar reminders to stay on top of key dates, ensuring you don’t miss any opportunities during your remote SEO job search.

## Conclusion

Finding legitimate remote SEO jobs involves combining modern search methods with careful employer research. Using advanced search operators and ATS URLs can help uncover job opportunities that might not appear on major job boards. This method supports the strategies discussed earlier, ensuring you focus on genuine positions.

Recent data shows companies like [Perrill](https://www.perrill.com/) and [Miles Partnership](https://www.milespartnership.com/) offering remote SEO roles with salaries ranging from $65,000 to over $80,000 as of April 2025. These examples highlight the increasing demand for SEO professionals across the U.S.

When considering job offers, watch out for common warning signs in remote SEO hiring. Be cautious of roles that:

-   Require webcam access or installation of unusual software
-   Involve unethical ranking practices
-   Provide commission-only pay structures
-   Demand unpaid test projects [\[15\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-things-i-learned-remote-seo-jobs-one-year-benjamin-shepardson-)

Use advanced search methods, track your applications as detailed in the application tracking section, and thoroughly evaluate potential employers. By researching companies and trusting your instincts, you can avoid questionable opportunities.

The remote SEO field is competitive but offers great potential. With these practical strategies and a careful approach, you're well-equipped to navigate this growing market confidently.
