## Weather in Medellín

### Local Climate Basics

Medellín enjoys a steady, mild climate with an average temperature of 72.5°F, thanks to its 4,900-foot elevation and proximity to the equator. This pleasant weather means there's usually no need for heating or air conditioning. Microclimates add some variety: areas like El Centro and Laureles-Estadio tend to be warmer, while neighborhoods such as El Poblado, Envigado, and Sabaneta are cooler. The city also maintains an average humidity of around 67.5% [\[3\]](https://medellinliving.com/weather-climate/).

### Month-by-Month Weather

Medellín's weather patterns are fairly predictable, with two rainy seasons - April through May and September through November - and a drier spell from December to March.

| Season | Months | Temp (°F) | Rainfall (in) | Humidity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dry Season | December – March | 71–72 | 4.21–6.30 | 83–84% |
| First Rainy Season | April – May | 73  | 8.17–8.56 | 84–85% |
| Mid-Year Transition | June – August | 73  | 6.47–7.16 | 79–81% |
| Second Rainy Season | September – November | 71–73 | 7.00–8.71 | 81–86% |

During the wettest months, expect rain on at least 21 days, but showers are typically brief, leaving plenty of time for daily activities [\[3\]](https://medellinliving.com/weather-climate/).

### Weather Planning Tips

Making the most of Medellín's climate can improve both your work and leisure time. Here are a few tips:

-   Opt for cooler neighborhoods like El Poblado or Envigado if you prefer milder weather.
-   Schedule outdoor activities or meetings in the mornings during rainy seasons, as rain is less likely early in the day.
-   Keep a small umbrella handy and check hourly forecasts to stay prepared.
-   Plan key in-person events during the dry season (December–March) for more predictable weather.

With its stable climate, Medellín offers a welcoming environment year-round. The dry season is particularly ideal for enjoying outdoor cafes and unwinding after work [\[3\]](https://medellinliving.com/weather-climate/).

### Current Internet Services

Medellín offers a dependable internet infrastructure, featuring a median fixed broadband download speed of **130.53 Mbps** and an upload speed of **33.06 Mbps** [\[5\]](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/colombia). These speeds are sufficient for tasks like video calls, file sharing, and other remote work needs, though slightly slower than Cartagena (146.74 Mbps) and Bogotá (132.47 Mbps) [\[5\]](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/colombia).
