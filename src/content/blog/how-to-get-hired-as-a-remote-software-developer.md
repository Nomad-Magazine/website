With remote work growing, companies value self-discipline, communication, and up-to-date tech skills. Start by updating your portfolio and resume, then explore remote job platforms and tech communities to connect with opportunities.

## Create Your Online Portfolio

An online portfolio is a must-have for securing remote developer roles. It showcases your technical skills and completed projects, giving employers a clear idea of your expertise and ability to work remotely. Think of it as a bridge connecting your technical know-how with your readiness for remote collaboration.

### Set Up Your [GitHub](https://github.com/) Profile

GitHub is a go-to platform for developers to showcase their work. A polished GitHub profile can boost your chances of landing interviews since many recruiters actively search the platform for talent [\[2\]](https://candor.co/articles/interview-prep/optimizing-your-developer-portfolio-in-github). Make sure your profile stands out by including your name, contact details, and relevant keywords in your bio. Pick a professional username that you're comfortable sharing with potential employers.

Here are some tips to make your GitHub profile shine:

-   Write detailed README files that explain each project's purpose and setup instructions.
-   Include clear documentation and well-placed code comments.
-   Keep your code clean and organized.
-   Add screenshots or demos to visually present your work.
-   Remove unmodified forks to keep your profile tidy.

A well-maintained GitHub profile is a great way to highlight your technical strengths.

### Highlight Current Tech Skills

Your portfolio should feature projects that demonstrate your expertise in relevant, in-demand technologies. For instance, Emily Ridge, a web developer, organizes her portfolio with a single-page overview and detailed landing pages for each project. These pages include client details, services provided, responsibilities, and live demo links [\[1\]](https://weworkremotely.com/how-to-build-your-remote-job-portfolio-and-stand-out-online). Consider structuring your portfolio similarly, with sections dedicated to various technical skills. Showcase a variety of projects, such as:

-   Full-stack applications
-   API integrations

### Keep Projects Updated

Consistently updating your portfolio shows initiative and adaptability - key traits for remote work. Here's how you can keep it fresh:

-   Add new projects that highlight your current skills.
-   Improve and refine existing projects.
-   Include work-in-progress projects to show ongoing learning.
-   Archive outdated projects to maintain relevance.

Consider creating a personal website using GitHub Pages to display your work. This is a great way to highlight your remote collaboration skills. Focus on projects that involve distributed teams, strong version control practices, detailed documentation, and experience with asynchronous communication tools.

Your portfolio should tell the story of your growth as a developer and your ability to thrive in remote roles. Keep it professional, up-to-date, and tailored to showcase your current strengths.

## Find Remote Job Listings

With your portfolio ready, it’s time to focus on finding remote job opportunities that align with your skills and goals.
