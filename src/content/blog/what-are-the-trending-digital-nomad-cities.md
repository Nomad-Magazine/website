For remote workers, the D7 Digital Nomad Visa requires proof of a monthly income at least four times the Portuguese minimum wage (about $3,489) [\[4\]](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/living-in-lisbon-as-a-digital-nomad/). This requirement has attracted a diverse international crowd, adding to Lisbon's lively expat community.

Lisbon sees about 300 sunny days a year [\[3\]](https://www.timeout.com/news/these-are-officially-the-best-cities-for-digital-nomads-in-2025-020425). While housing costs have risen - apartment prices climbed 17% by December 2023 to nearly €21 per square meter (around $2.07 per square foot) [\[5\]](https://www.portugal.com/moving-to-portugal/updated-2024-cost-of-living-in-lisbon/) - the city is still 30% cheaper than Paris and 50% cheaper than London [\[5\]](https://www.portugal.com/moving-to-portugal/updated-2024-cost-of-living-in-lisbon/).

**Tips for Nomads**: Use the [Croissant](https://www.getcroissant.com/) app for coworking access (starting at $31 for 10 hours). Get a Passe Navegante for unlimited public transit.
