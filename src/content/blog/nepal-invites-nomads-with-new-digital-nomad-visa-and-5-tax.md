## Nepal's Digital Nomad Visa Explained

Nepal has introduced a Digital Nomad Visa, offering a five-year multiple-entry permit with the option for annual residency renewals. This program is designed for remote-working professionals and their families who want to make Nepal their long-term home, providing more perks than a standard tourist visa.

### Who Can Apply

To qualify, applicants must work remotely for non-Nepali companies and meet specific financial requirements: either a monthly income of at least $1,500 or proof of savings totaling $20,000. Additionally, applicants must have international health insurance with coverage of $100,000. The program is family-friendly, allowing spouses and dependents to join the primary applicant [\[1\]](https://nomadsembassy.com/nepal-digital-nomad-visa).

### Main Benefits

This visa comes with several practical advantages. Holders can open accounts in Nepal’s commercial banks, register vehicles in their own name, and even have foreign driving licenses validated for use within the country [\[3\]](https://traveltradejournal.com/nepal-plans-to-roll-out-digital-nomad-visa-policy-within-a-year). For those with savings exceeding $50,000, the program allows transferring amounts above this threshold to foreign banks, providing extra financial flexibility [\[3\]](https://traveltradejournal.com/nepal-plans-to-roll-out-digital-nomad-visa-policy-within-a-year).

Deepak Raj Joshi, CEO of the [Nepal Tourism Board](https://ntb.gov.np/), highlights what makes Nepal an attractive destination:

> "Nepal offers an appealing environment for digital nomads, with access to cafes, pubs, and a wide range of cultural festivals." [\[3\]](https://traveltradejournal.com/nepal-plans-to-roll-out-digital-nomad-visa-policy-within-a-year)

### How to Apply

Although the program promises enticing benefits, the application process is still being finalized. Implementation is expected by May 2025, with a formal policy document outlining the procedures and requirements set to be released during this time [\[2\]](https://kathmandupost.com/money/2025/05/28/nepal-eyes-tourism-economic-boost-with-new-digital-nomad-visa-policy). The program will be managed by multiple government agencies, including the Tourism, Home Affairs, Information Technology, and Finance ministries, all under the supervision of the Office of the Prime Minister [\[2\]](https://kathmandupost.com/money/2025/05/28/nepal-eyes-tourism-economic-boost-with-new-digital-nomad-visa-policy).

Given the detailed paperwork involved, it’s wise to consult a local legal or consulting firm to ensure the process goes smoothly once applications open.

## Nepal's 5% Tax Rate for Digital Nomads

Nepal's **5% flat tax rate** stands out as a highly competitive option for digital nomads. It applies to remote workers who spend at least 183 days a year in the country, making them tax residents. Unlike progressive tax systems, this flat rate ensures simplicity - 5% of your income, no matter how much you earn. This straightforward approach eliminates the hassle of dealing with multiple tax brackets and fluctuating obligations.

For digital nomads with variable incomes, this predictability is a game-changer. It simplifies financial planning and budgeting, offering peace of mind when managing your earnings.

### Tax Examples by Income Level

To illustrate how this flat rate works, here are a few examples across different income levels:

-   If you earn **$3,000 per month** ($36,000 annually), your total tax for the year will be just **$1,800**.
-   Earning **$5,000 monthly** ($60,000 annually) means a tax bill of **$3,000**.
-   High earners making **$10,000 per month** ($120,000 annually) would pay **$6,000** in taxes.

This clarity and simplicity make Nepal’s tax system particularly appealing, especially when compared to more complex multi-bracket systems.

### How Nepal Compares to Other Countries

Nepal’s 5% flat tax rate places it among the most tax-friendly destinations for digital nomads. While some countries, such as the UAE, Malta, Costa Rica, and several Caribbean nations, offer **0% tax rates**, Nepal combines its low tax rate with an affordable cost of living and rich cultural experiences[\[4\]](https://immigrantinvest.com/blog/digital-nomad-taxes).

For comparison, popular European destinations often have higher tax burdens. In Portugal, digital nomads face progressive tax rates ranging from **43.5% to 48%** after 183 days of residency[\[4\]](https://immigrantinvest.com/blog/digital-nomad-taxes). Spain offers a **24% fixed rate** on income up to €600,000 per year[\[4\]](https://immigrantinvest.com/blog/digital-nomad-taxes), while Hungary charges a **15% flat rate** for those staying over 183 days[\[4\]](https://immigrantinvest.com/blog/digital-nomad-taxes).

| Country | Tax Rate for Nomads | Income Threshold | Visa Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nepal | 5%  | All income levels | 5 years |
| Hungary | 15% | All income levels | 1 + 1 year |
| Spain | 24% | Up to €600,000/year | 3 + 2 years |
| Portugal | 43.5-48% | Progressive scale | 2 + 3 years |
| Malta | 0%  | Foreign income only | 1 + 3 years |

Even when compared to other low-tax destinations, Nepal remains a strong contender. For instance, Georgia offers a **1% tax rate**, but only for annual earnings below $155,000; higher rates apply beyond that threshold[\[5\]](https://newbusinessage.com/article/making-nepal-remote-work-ready). Nepal’s flat 5% rate, which applies regardless of income, is particularly attractive for high earners.

Moreover, Nepal’s low cost of living amplifies its appeal. While you might save on taxes in a zero-tax country, daily expenses like housing and groceries can be significantly higher. Nepal strikes a rare balance - low taxes, affordable living costs, and a vibrant lifestyle - making it an enticing choice for digital nomads looking to maximize their savings and enjoy a rich cultural experience.

## Internet and Workspace Options in Nepal

Nepal has made impressive strides in its digital infrastructure, catering to the needs of remote workers and digital nomads. With reliable internet services and a growing number of coworking spaces, the country is becoming an attractive option for those seeking flexible work environments.

### Internet Speed and Reliability

As of January 2025, Nepal’s fixed internet boasts a median speed of 70.94 Mbps, marking a 22.7% increase compared to the previous year[\[6\]](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-nepal). These speeds are more than adequate for tasks like video calls, large file transfers, and using cloud-based applications. On the mobile front, 4G networks now cover all 77 districts, with 80.5% of mobile connections classified as broadband[\[6\]](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-nepal). Internet penetration has reached 55.8%, serving 16.5 million users, while mobile connections saw a rise of 2 million (a 5.4% growth) between early 2024 and early 2025[\[6\]](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-nepal).

While 5G trials have taken place, full-scale deployment is still limited due to high infrastructure costs. However, the existing 4G network is sufficient for most remote work needs, and further investments are planned to enhance connectivity[\[2\]](https://kathmandupost.com/money/2025/05/28/nepal-eyes-tourism-economic-boost-with-new-digital-nomad-visa-policy). This stable internet foundation is complemented by the availability of coworking spaces, creating a seamless experience for remote professionals.

### Coworking Spaces in Nepal

Kathmandu and Pokhara are the main hubs for coworking spaces, each offering unique experiences. Kathmandu provides a range of options, from budget-friendly to premium, while Pokhara offers a more relaxed environment without compromising on essential amenities.

In Kathmandu, **[Work Around](https://www.coworker.com/nepal/kathmandu/work-around)** provides shared spaces for Rs. 4,500 per month (around $40) and private offices for Rs. 16,000 (approximately $142)[\[8\]](https://bucketlistbri.com/kathmandu-digital-nomad). **[Raya Space](https://rayaspace.com/)** in Maharajgunj is another popular choice, featuring high-speed WiFi, ergonomic furniture, parking, and complimentary beverages. Their Startup Rooms cost Rs. 25,000 per month (about $222), while Executive Rooms are priced at Rs. 35,000 (roughly $311)[\[9\]](https://rayaspace.com). Other options include **[Hub108](https://www.hub108.com/)** at Rs. 10,000 per month (around $89), **The 100** at Rs. 6,800 (roughly $60), and **[Haushala Co-Working Space](https://www.coworker.com/nepal/patan/haushala-co-working-space)** in Patan at Rs. 4,000 (about $35)[\[10\]](https://www.coworker.com/nepal).

Pokhara, known for its tranquil vibe, also caters to remote workers with well-equipped coworking spaces. **[BROWNDESK](https://www.coworker.com/nepal/pokhara/browndesk-co-working-space)** on Bishal Marga offers amenities such as WiFi, lounge areas, outdoor terraces, free drinking water, and printing services[\[7\]](https://community.freakingnomads.com/workspaces/coworking/nepal). **[Gyan Hub](https://www.facebook.com/gyanhubpkr/)** on Janapriya Marga adds air conditioning, standing desks, and kitchen facilities to its offerings, with rates starting at Rs. 10,000 per month (around $89)[\[7\]](https://community.freakingnomads.com/workspaces/coworking/nepal). For those looking for a combined living and working experience, a coworking and coliving space on Phewa Marga provides integrated options.

Here’s a quick comparison of some coworking spaces across Nepal:

| Location | Coworking Space | Monthly Rate | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kathmandu | Work Around | Rs. 4,500 ($40) | Shared workspace, collaborative atmosphere |
| Kathmandu | Raya Space (Startup Room) | Rs. 25,000 ($222) | High-speed WiFi, ergonomic furniture, parking |

| Pokhara | [Nucleus Co-Working](https://www.coworker.com/nepal/pokhara/nucleus-co-working-office) | Rs. 5,000 ($44) | Budget-friendly, lakeside location |

Both Kathmandu and Pokhara offer essential amenities like consistent electricity and high-speed internet, ensuring a smooth work experience. These coworking spaces highlight Nepal’s readiness to support the growing digital nomad community, creating flexible and productive environments for remote workers.

## Cost of Living in Nepal for Remote Workers

Living in Nepal is a budget-friendly option for digital nomads, with overall costs being **64.7% lower than in the United States**. For a single person, monthly expenses - including food, transportation, utilities, and personal care - average around $445 (₨50,014), offering a great balance between affordability and comfort[\[13\]](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nepal). Savings can be found across all major expense categories like housing, dining, and transportation.

### Housing Costs

Housing in Nepal varies depending on location, furnishings, and available amenities. In Kathmandu, a one-bedroom apartment in the city center averages $180 per month (₨20,214). For those willing to live outside the city center, the monthly rent drops to about $102 (₨11,486)[\[15\]](https://wise.com/gb/cost-of-living/nepal).

If you're looking for short-term stays, furnished apartments start at $18 per day (₨2,000). These typically include furniture, kitchen essentials, and sometimes utilities, making them a convenient option for remote workers seeking hassle-free arrangements[\[12\]](https://rentinnepal.com/apartment-rent-in-nepal).

Co-living spaces are another popular choice, offering shared amenities like kitchens, lounges, and workspaces. These setups often provide better value, especially for shorter stays, while fostering a sense of community[\[11\]](https://www.purbelirealestate.com/blogs/co-living-spaces-blog).

For even greater savings, consider living outside Kathmandu. Smaller towns like Chitwan and Lumbini offer mid-range accommodations priced between $13 and $25 per night (₨1,500 to ₨3,000). Luxury stays in these areas range from $42 to $126 per night (₨5,000 to ₨15,000), which is much cheaper compared to Kathmandu’s luxury hotel rates of $84 to $252 per night (₨10,000 to ₨30,000)[\[16\]](https://www.trip.com/guide/info/trip-to-nepal-cost.html).

### Food, Transport, and Other Expenses

Nepal also offers low taxes and affordable visa options, adding to its appeal for remote workers.

Food costs are incredibly low, making dining out an easy and enjoyable part of daily life. A meal at a local restaurant costs just $2.22 (₨250), while a mid-range dinner for two averages $22.22 (₨2,500)[\[13\]](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nepal).

For those who prefer cooking at home, grocery prices are equally affordable. You can buy a liter of milk for $1.02 (₨115), a dozen eggs for $2.04 (₨230), and a kilogram of tomatoes for $0.81 (₨91)[\[14\]](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/nepal).

| Expense Category | Cost (USD) | Cost (NPR) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inexpensive restaurant meal | $2.22 | ₨250 |

| Mobile plan (10GB+ data) | $6.06 | ₨682 |

Transportation is another area where Nepal shines in affordability. A single bus ticket costs just $0.27 (₨30), while a monthly public transport pass is $13.33 (₨1,500)[\[13\]](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nepal). Taxis are also reasonably priced, starting at $2.67 (₨300) per ride.

Utility bills for a standard 915-square-foot apartment average $41.08 per month (₨4,619). This covers electricity, heating, cooling, water, and garbage collection[\[13\]](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nepal). Internet, which is essential for remote work, costs $11.28 per month (₨1,268) for unlimited data with speeds of 60 Mbps or higher. Mobile plans with calls and 10GB+ data are available for just $6.06 per month (₨682)[\[13\]](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Nepal).

With such low costs across the board, Nepal allows digital nomads to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle while saving money. Affordable housing, dining, and transportation, combined with reasonable utility expenses, make it an excellent choice for those seeking to stretch their income while immersing themselves in a vibrant and culturally rich environment.

## Daily Life in Nepal as a Digital Nomad

Nepal offers digital nomads a unique blend of vibrant traditions, breathtaking landscapes, and a rich cultural experience.

### Local Customs and Etiquette

Understanding and respecting local customs is key to building meaningful connections in Nepal. A respectful "namaste" (palms pressed together with a slight bow) is the customary greeting, especially when addressing elders [\[17\]](https://www.nathab.com/know-before-you-go/asia-the-pacific/bhutan-nepal/cultural-dos-and-donts/cultural-dos-and-donts-in-nepal). When visiting religious sites, be aware that many Hindu temples may restrict access to non-Hindu visitors in certain areas and often prohibit leather items. Always seek permission before photographing people or sacred objects [\[17\]](https://www.nathab.com/know-before-you-go/asia-the-pacific/bhutan-nepal/cultural-dos-and-donts/cultural-dos-and-donts-in-nepal). If you come across mani stones or stupas, walk with your right side facing them and never sit on these sacred objects [\[17\]](https://www.nathab.com/know-before-you-go/asia-the-pacific/bhutan-nepal/cultural-dos-and-donts/cultural-dos-and-donts-in-nepal).

Be mindful of cultural norms: use your right hand for eating or exchanging items, avoid pointing your feet at people or sacred objects, and dress modestly, particularly when visiting temples or private homes [\[17\]](https://www.nathab.com/know-before-you-go/asia-the-pacific/bhutan-nepal/cultural-dos-and-donts/cultural-dos-and-donts-in-nepal)[\[18\]](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/nepalese-culture/nepalese-culture-etiquette). Always remove your shoes and hats before entering homes or religious spaces, and avoid entering someone’s home unless invited. If offered tea, accept it graciously as a gesture of hospitality. Life in Nepal often follows "Nepali time", which reflects a more relaxed and unhurried pace. Show respect to elders by avoiding public displays of affection and keeping emotions like anger in check [\[17\]](https://www.nathab.com/know-before-you-go/asia-the-pacific/bhutan-nepal/cultural-dos-and-donts/cultural-dos-and-donts-in-nepal)[\[18\]](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/nepalese-culture/nepalese-culture-etiquette). Learning a few basic Nepali phrases can go a long way in showing respect and building rapport with locals [\[19\]](https://nomad.digital/asia/nepal).

### Things to Do and See in Nepal

Nepal is a treasure trove of cultural landmarks, natural wonders, and thrilling adventures. It’s home to [Mount Everest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest), the tallest mountain in the world, and the Kali Gandaki, one of the deepest canyons on Earth at nearly 14,350 feet [\[21\]](https://guide.genki.world/nepal).

The Kathmandu Valley serves as a cultural hub. Start with Durbar Square in Kathmandu, where ancient architecture showcases the country’s rich history [\[20\]](https://digitalnomads.world/city-guide/kathmandu). Visit [Swayambhunath Stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath), also known as the Monkey Temple, and [Boudhanath Stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudha_Stupa), one of the largest Buddhist stupas in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage site [\[20\]](https://digitalnomads.world/city-guide/kathmandu). For a step back in time, explore Bhaktapur, a medieval city known for its intricate wood carvings, pottery squares, and narrow cobblestone streets [\[20\]](https://digitalnomads.world/city-guide/kathmandu).

In Pokhara, take a half-day hike to the Peace Pagoda for breathtaking Himalayan views or enjoy a serene boat ride on Phewa Lake. The International Mountain Museum offers a fascinating look at Nepal’s mountaineering history, while natural attractions like Devi’s Fall and Gupteshwor Cave provide unique geological insights [\[20\]](https://digitalnomads.world/city-guide/kathmandu).

For wildlife lovers, [Chitwan National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitwan_National_Park) offers jungle safaris where you might spot rhinos, tigers, and elephants. You can also engage with the local Tharu community for a deeper cultural experience [\[20\]](https://digitalnomads.world/city-guide/kathmandu). Nagarkot, known for its stunning sunrise views over the Himalayas, is perfect for meditation or a digital detox. Meanwhile, Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha and a UNESCO World Heritage site, provides a serene retreat for personal and professional rejuvenation.

If you’re looking to integrate into the community, [Volunteer Society Nepal](https://www.volunteersocietynepal.org/welcome-to-volunteer-society-nepal/)’s [Digital Nomad Program](https://www.nomadgossip.com/nomad_directory) combines remote work with volunteering opportunities in your field [\[22\]](https://www.volunteersocietynepal.org/digital-nomad-program). This program includes amenities like shared office spaces, accommodations, cultural introductions, language classes, and even airport pickup. To connect with other remote workers, explore coworking spaces, popular cafes, Facebook groups, or apps like Bumble Friends [\[23\]](https://www.findawayabroad.com/post/living-in-pokhara-nepal). For an immersive experience, consider a homestay with a Nepali family to gain firsthand insight into the local way of life [\[22\]](https://www.volunteersocietynepal.org/digital-nomad-program).

Nepal’s diverse landscapes and cultural richness offer countless opportunities to explore and connect during your downtime, making it an exceptional choice for digital nomads seeking both productivity and meaningful experiences. Every moment spent here adds depth to your professional journey and personal growth.

## Why Nepal Works for Digital Nomads

Nepal’s new Digital Nomad Visa is a game-changer, offering long-term residency and financial perks for remote workers. This five-year, multiple-entry visa allows digital nomads to establish a solid base in one of the most captivating destinations in the world. On top of that, the visa introduces financial benefits that make Nepal an attractive choice for remote professionals.

One standout feature is the flat 5% income tax rate for those staying over 183 days - a stark contrast to the higher tax rates in many other countries. Deepak Raj Joshi, CEO of the Nepal Tourism Board, highlights the appeal:

> "The policy will promote longer tourist stays and attract individuals with strong earning potential, particularly those working in information and technology...digital nomads typically have disposable income and are high-quality tourists." [\[3\]](https://traveltradejournal.com/nepal-plans-to-roll-out-digital-nomad-visa-policy-within-a-year)[\[25\]](https://www.thedailystar.net/around-asia/news/nepal-eyes-tourism-economic-boost-new-digital-nomad-visa-policy-3906301)

Pair this with Nepal’s low cost of living - where you can enjoy affordable meals and reasonably priced city center apartments - and it’s easy to see why this country is turning heads [\[26\]](https://english.onlinekhabar.com/remote-work-in-nepal-unleashing-tourism-potential-through-digital-nomad-policies.html)[\[19\]](https://nomad.digital/asia/nepal).

Nepal’s vision for its IT sector is another major draw. The government’s "IT Decade" (2024–2034) aims to create 1.5 million tech jobs and generate NPR 3 trillion in IT service exports. By 2025, internet penetration is expected to hit 79%, and mobile connectivity already exceeds 124%. These advancements support a remote workforce, which studies show can be 35–40% more productive. This forward-thinking strategy aligns perfectly with Nepal’s ongoing improvements in internet infrastructure and coworking spaces [\[24\]](https://www.nucamp.co/blog/coding-bootcamp-nepal-npl-top-10-strategies-to-land-your-first-remote-tech-job-from-nepal-in-2025).

But it’s not just about technology. Nepal’s tight-knit and welcoming community offers plenty of opportunities for connection and growth. Stories like Patricia Thompson’s journey to becoming a remote software developer in Kathmandu or Sabin Gurung’s success as an IT Support Technician at [Foundation BTS](https://foundationbts.com/) illustrate how immersing yourself in the local tech scene can lead to unexpected opportunities [\[24\]](https://www.nucamp.co/blog/coding-bootcamp-nepal-npl-top-10-strategies-to-land-your-first-remote-tech-job-from-nepal-in-2025).

Outside of work, Nepal offers a perfect balance of adventure and relaxation. With eight of the world’s ten highest mountains, you can trek to Everest Base Camp, paraglide in Pokhara, or simply soak in the breathtaking landscapes. Add to that the country’s rich Hindu and Buddhist traditions, which provide daily chances for cultural exploration, and you’ve got an environment that promotes both personal and professional well-being. The laid-back lifestyle here can help ease the stresses of remote work, making it a perfect spot for recharging.

With 91% of remote workers reporting positive experiences and 36% advancing their careers faster [\[24\]](https://www.nucamp.co/blog/coding-bootcamp-nepal-npl-top-10-strategies-to-land-your-first-remote-tech-job-from-nepal-in-2025), Nepal isn’t just an affordable place to live - it’s a destination where professionals can thrive. The combination of stunning scenery, a supportive community, and opportunities for growth solidifies Nepal as a top choice for digital nomads seeking more than just a place to work. It’s a place to truly live.

## FAQs

### What do I need to apply for Nepal’s new Digital Nomad Visa, and how does the process work?

## How to Apply for Nepal’s Digital Nomad Visa

Getting Nepal’s Digital Nomad Visa will be a straightforward online process once applications officially open. To qualify, you’ll need to prepare a few key documents:

-   **A Valid Passport**: A clear copy of your passport to confirm your identity.
-   **Proof of Remote Work**: This could be an employment contract or a letter from your employer that verifies your remote work arrangement.
-   **Proof of Income**: You’ll need to demonstrate a monthly income of at least $1,500 or show that you have a bank balance exceeding $20,000.
-   **Health Insurance**: A policy with a minimum coverage of $100,000 that includes medical treatment in Nepal.

The visa will be valid for five years, offering multiple entries. This means digital nomads can immerse themselves in Nepal’s rich culture and enjoy an affordable lifestyle while working remotely.

### How does Nepal's 5% tax for digital nomads compare to taxes in other countries?

Nepal’s flat 5% tax rate for digital nomads stands out as a competitive alternative to the often higher tax rates in other parts of the world. Take the U.S., for example - federal income tax rates can climb up to 37%, and that’s before factoring in state taxes, which vary significantly. Across Europe, personal income tax rates typically range between 20% and 50%.

This modest 5% rate positions Nepal as an appealing destination for remote workers, particularly those coming from countries with higher tax burdens. Pair this with Nepal’s affordable cost of living, its vibrant heritage, and an improving digital infrastructure, and it’s easy to see why the country is drawing attention from digital nomads eager to balance financial savings with a distinctive lifestyle.

### What challenges might digital nomads face while living and working in Nepal with the new Digital Nomad Visa?

## Challenges of the Digital Nomad Visa in Nepal

Nepal’s new Digital Nomad Visa, paired with its appealing 5% tax rate, is certainly a draw for remote workers. However, there are a few hurdles worth noting.

One significant issue is internet reliability. While urban areas tend to have better connectivity, rural and remote regions often experience inconsistent service, which could disrupt productivity for those relying heavily on stable internet. Beyond connectivity, infrastructure like transportation and healthcare may not match the standards many nomads are used to in more developed nations.

Another potential challenge lies in navigating local bureaucracy. Tasks like extending visas or understanding regulations can be both time-consuming and complicated. For individuals planning a long-term stay, adjusting to these aspects of daily life in Nepal might take some patience and adaptability.

That said, the trade-off often feels worthwhile. Nepal offers a blend of affordable living and rich cultural experiences that many find hard to resist. For those who can embrace the quirks and challenges, the rewards are undeniably enticing.
