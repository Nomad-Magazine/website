## Speed & Reliability Tests

Airalo provides mostly stable 4G LTE service, with occasional 5G availability in certain markets. Tests across various global locations show reliable connectivity, making it a practical choice for travelers and digital nomads.

### Global Performance Metrics

| Location | Download Speed | Network Type | Reliability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tokyo | 25 Mbps | 4G LTE | Good |
| Kansai | 15 Mbps | 4G LTE | Good |
| London | 7 Mbps | 4G/5G | Excellent |
| Taipei | 34.2 Mbps | 4G LTE | Excellent |

### Urban vs. Rural Coverage

In cities, performance supports everyday tasks like navigation, social media, and remote work. Even in more remote areas, connectivity remains strong. For instance, users at Elafonissi Beach in Greece reported consistent 4G LTE signals, allowing smooth voice calls [\[9\]](https://www.travelerchoice.com/blogs/all-blogs/airalo-review?srsltid=AfmBOorgvt1NHjYIG2cXnkELpPjjky1vCLmqoc1hFkxTKlChZBrV7cQj).

### Regional Performance Highlights

European networks show varying results. Italyâ€™s Puglia region provides access to 5G [\[7\]](https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/tech-tips/airalo-speeds), while speeds in the UK average 7 Mbps with dependable reliability [\[10\]](https://www.monito.com/en/wiki/airalo-vs-holafly). In the Netherlands, initial setup can sometimes cause minor issues, but these are quickly resolved with proper configuration [\[9\]](https://www.travelerchoice.com/blogs/all-blogs/airalo-review?srsltid=AfmBOorgvt1NHjYIG2cXnkELpPjjky1vCLmqoc1hFkxTKlChZBrV7cQj).

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Speed fluctuations often result from network congestion, APN configuration problems, or device limitations. To improve performance, ensure your eSIM is activated, double-check APN settings, toggle between networks, or switch to 3G if necessary [\[8\]](https://www.airalo.com/help/troubleshooting/0UEL63PDK5IJ/i-am-experiencing-slow-network-speeds/P552TT4B5EMM?srsltid=AfmBOoq5PNp4hjmA8kHZnV0CzI0HnBpZUTgmBhryK6IzYcz7rVKhDtIJ).

### Technical Support

Airaloâ€™s email support team is quick to address configuration problems, but real-time support is not available [\[7\]](https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/tech-tips/airalo-speeds). The app includes troubleshooting guides, and users can contact support for help with optimizing network settings [\[8\]](https://www.airalo.com/help/troubleshooting/0UEL63PDK5IJ/i-am-experiencing-slow-network-speeds/P552TT4B5EMM?srsltid=AfmBOoq5PNp4hjmA8kHZnV0CzI0HnBpZUTgmBhryK6IzYcz7rVKhDtIJ).

These findings highlight Airaloâ€™s ability to deliver reliable connectivity in diverse locations, paving the way for a closer look at its strengths and challenges.

## Key Benefits & Limitations

Airalo's eSIM service has both perks and drawbacks for travelers.

### Major Advantages

#### Affordable Global Coverage

Airalo provides broad international coverage with flexible plans designed to suit different travel needs [\[2\]](https://www.aworldinreach.com/airalo-esim-review/).

#### Easy Setup & Convenience

You can buy and set up your eSIM before your trip, avoiding the hassle of finding local SIM cards or dealing with language barriers [\[12\]](https://www.travelerchoice.com/blogs/all-blogs/airalo-review?srsltid=AfmBOorSDzJ3CzZ-zG09vuP7JY-P5pSsUzeyvbgz8D08p6H9SYa4qdJ0).

#### Added Security

Since eSIMs are digital, there's no risk of losing or having a physical SIM card stolen. Plus, the Airalo app makes managing your profiles straightforward [\[11\]](https://www.airalo.com/blog/the-difference-between-esims-and-physical-sims?srsltid=AfmBOoqZ-qAvGIEzLHAfVvnwMU76p-BiTySWC5t1D2u5ZzV5ehPWRZfI). This is especially helpful for digital nomads balancing work and travel.

### Notable Limitations

-   **Data-Only Plans**: Most plans donâ€™t include calls or texts, so youâ€™ll need messaging apps for communication.
-   **No Data Alerts**: There arenâ€™t any notifications for low data; youâ€™ll need to track your usage manually.
-   **Device Compatibility**: Only works with eSIM-compatible, unlocked devices. Be sure to check compatibility before buying.

While customer service response times can vary, especially in smaller countries, the appâ€™s user-friendly design and tiered credit system are a big plus for frequent travelers. These features complement the service's technical strengths and affordability.

### Cost Structure

Airaloâ€™s pricing is flexible, offering regional and global plans to fit different budgets [\[4\]](https://travelesimexpert.com/airalo-vs-nomad/).

## Final Verdict

Airalo is a solid option for international travelers in 2025, especially for those looking for reliable data connectivity at an affordable price.

### For Digital Nomads & Long-Term Travelers

Airalo's long-term plans are a great fit for those who need consistent connectivity.
