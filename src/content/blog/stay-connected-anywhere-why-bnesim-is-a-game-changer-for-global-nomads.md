## Common Connection Problems

Global nomads often struggle with staying connected while abroad.

### Expensive Roaming Fees

International roaming charges from traditional carriers can be a financial burden. Luca Mattei, CEO of BNESIM, highlights the issue:

> "Many potential users aren't aware that such services exist. They're not exploring them because they don't know the concept of eSIMs providing global coverage. This means they continue to endure paying expensive roaming fees, struggling with local SIM cards, and depending on unreliable Wi-Fi." [\[3\]](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/309352/20250212/stay-connected-anywhere-bnesims-vision-redefining-travel-communication.htm)

This lack of awareness keeps many nomads stuck with costly and inconvenient options.

### Limited Internet Access

Stable internet access is another major obstacle. Digital nomads frequently face:

-   Unreliable public Wi-Fi that can’t consistently support remote work
-   Spotty cellular coverage in remote areas, disrupting important meetings or tasks

When connections drop during critical moments, it can lead to frustration and missed opportunities [\[3\]](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/309352/20250212/stay-connected-anywhere-bnesims-vision-redefining-travel-communication.htm).

### Multiple Phone Numbers

Managing international communication adds another layer of complexity. Common issues include:

-   Needing country-specific numbers to maintain a local presence for business
-   Juggling multiple numbers across different regions

BNESIM simplifies this by letting users manage numbers from over 100 countries within a single account [\[4\]](https://dev.bnesim.com/virtualsim/get-extra-numbers/).
