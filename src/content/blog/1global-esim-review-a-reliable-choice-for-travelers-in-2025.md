[1Global](https://www.1global.com/) eSIM simplifies staying connected while traveling in 2025. With coverage in 190+ countries and partnerships with 600+ networks, it offers reliable, instant activation and eco-friendly digital SIMs. Plans are tailored for single regions, multi-regions, or global travel, with prices starting at $31 for 6GB/15 days. Key features include automatic carrier switching, reduced costs (average $5.50/GB), and basic connectivity even after plan expiry. Compatible with most modern devices, it’s a practical solution for frequent travelers and businesses alike.

## Network Coverage Map

1Global's network reaches over 190 countries, thanks to partnerships with more than 600 networks worldwide [\[2\]](https://www.1global.com). The strongest coverage is found in the 1GLOBAL Zone, which includes key regions like the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, Australia, Hong Kong, Poland, and the Netherlands [\[4\]](https://docs.things.1global.com/docs/network/).

What makes 1Global different? Its network architecture is designed to be efficient and reliable. Instead of routing all traffic through one central hub, 1Global uses multiple Points of Presence (POPs) across four continents [\[4\]](https://docs.things.1global.com/docs/network/). This approach ensures your connection is routed through the nearest POP, improving voice quality and speeding up data connections.

Here’s a quick look at coverage in specific regions:

| Region | Primary Network Partners | Coverage Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Austria | A1, Drei | Direct Roaming |
| Japan | [KDDI](https://www.kddi.com/english/), [Docomo](https://www.docomo.ne.jp/english/) | Direct Roaming |
| US/UK/Germany | Multiple Tier-1 Carriers | MVNO Agreements |

1Global uses patented Multi-IMSI technology to switch between carriers dynamically [\[4\]](https://docs.things.1global.com/docs/network/). For example, in Japan, your device can seamlessly switch between KDDI, Docomo, and [Softbank](https://www.softbank.jp/en//), depending on signal strength.

The network supports 2G, 3G, 4G, and LTE-M technologies [\[4\]](https://docs.things.1global.com/docs/network/), with availability depending on your location. With direct agreements with major carriers and fallback roaming access, 1Global ensures you stay connected in cities, tourist hotspots, and transit hubs.

A team of over 400 experts in 15 offices worldwide [\[2\]](https://www.1global.com) works to enhance network performance continuously. New carrier agreements are added automatically, so travelers benefit from competitive rates and reliable connectivity wherever they go [\[4\]](https://docs.things.1global.com/docs/network/).

## Data Plans and Costs

1Global offers a range of data plans designed to meet the needs of travelers. Their SmartEnterprise Prepaid Data Plans provide instant mobile connectivity across more than 160 countries with upfront pricing details [\[2\]](https://www.1global.com).

The company offers different plans tailored to various travel scenarios:

-   **Single Region Plans**: Perfect for trips focused on one country or region.
-   **Multi-Region Plans**: Ideal for travel across multiple regions.
