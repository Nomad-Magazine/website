[Hubud](https://workfrom.co/hubud) and [Dojo Bali](https://dojobali.org/) transformed Bali into a digital nomad hotspot. They introduced coworking spaces that combined work, community, and lifestyle, attracting remote workers to Canggu and Ubud. Here's what you need to know:

-   **Hubud**: Opened in 2013 in Ubud, known for its bamboo design and focus on blending work with lifestyle.
-   **Dojo Bali**: Established in Canggu near Echo Beach, offering high-speed internet, meeting rooms, and even a pool. It closed in 2022.
-   **Impact**: Over 10,000 visitors, community programs, and success stories like [GO-JEK](https://www.gojek.com/en-id) and local initiatives like [Merah Putih Hijau](https://mph-bali.org/en/about/).

These spaces redefined remote work, fostering collaboration, supporting local communities, and inspiring coworking models worldwide. Today, Bali remains a top destination for digital nomads, with affordable living costs and evolving coworking trends.

## History of [Hubud](https://workfrom.co/hubud) and [Dojo Bali](https://dojobali.org/)

### Hubud: Beginnings in Ubud

Hubud opened its doors in March 2013 as Bali’s first coworking space. It was founded by Steve Munroe, Peter Wall, and John Alderson, who initially launched with a pop-up coworking space and spent a year hosting community events before the official opening[\[1\]](https://hubud.org/about/our-story/). The space stood out with its bamboo design, inspired by Bali’s natural surroundings. The founders saw Bali as a magnet for "mavericks and corporate escapees" searching for a different way to live and work[\[1\]](https://hubud.org/about/our-story/).

> "We wanted to create an unprecedented space that embodied the freedom paradigm of work + lifestyle." – Hubud[\[1\]](https://hubud.org/about/our-story/)

### Dojo Bali: A New Chapter in Canggu

Dojo Bali set up shop in Canggu to meet the needs of remote professionals looking for more than just fast Wi-Fi. It provided a full setup for work and life, including high-speed internet, conference rooms, and even a swimming pool. This made it a go-to spot for digital nomads in the area[\[2\]](https://dojobali.org/)[\[4\]](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-dojo-bali-is-empowering-digital-nomads-and-the_b_5872f10ce4b0a5e600a78c64).

### 2019: The Merger

In 2019, Hubud and Dojo Bali combined forces, creating a major moment in Bali’s coworking movement. However, after seven years of operation, Dojo Bali officially closed in December 2022[\[2\]](https://dojobali.org/).

## Workspace Features

### Hubud's Main Offerings

Hubud's bamboo-inspired design merges natural elements with a productive atmosphere. The main workspace (129 m²/1,388 ft²) accommodates 35–50 members, while the elevated Loft (67 m²/721 ft²) can host up to 40 people [\[5\]](https://hubud.org/about/space-rental/).

For focused work and private meetings, Hubud provides:

-   **Conference Room**: 28 m² (301 ft²), seating up to 15 people
-   **Meeting Room**: 7.7 m² (83 ft²), designed for 6 people
-   **Skype Booths**: Compact 1.2 m² (13 ft²) spaces for individual calls [\[5\]](https://hubud.org/about/space-rental/)

The workspace features shared desks, ergonomic chairs, and casual seating options like bean bags, blending comfort and functionality. Members also have access to the Café & Garden area (91 m²/980 ft²), a versatile space for events and networking that can host 30–100 people [\[5\]](https://hubud.org/about/space-rental/).

In comparison, Dojo Bali offered a different take on the coworking experience, detailed below.

### Dojo Bali's Facilities

Before closing in December 2022, Dojo Bali operated as a two-story coworking space near Echo Beach. Its setup catered to both work and leisure, with distinct features:

| Area | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | High-speed internet, air-conditioned rooms, soundproof Skype booths |
| Outdoor | Swimming pool, tropical gardens |
| Meeting Spaces | Air-conditioned conference rooms |
| Location | Just a one-minute walk from Echo Beach [\[2\]](https://dojobali.org/)[\[3\]](https://dojobali.org/about/) |

Membership plans ranged from $58 to $213 per month, depending on access hours [\[6\]](https://www.christhefreelancer.com/coworking-spaces-bali-digital-nomads/). These pricing options allowed flexibility for various work styles and budgets, complementing the venue's amenities.

### Community Programs

Both Hubud and Dojo Bali prioritized community engagement through events focused on Inspiration, Knowledge, Cogiving, and Networking. These gatherings adhered to a strict no-sell policy, encouraging authentic connections [\[7\]](https://hubud.org/events/)[\[9\]](https://dojobali.org/events/).

At Hubud, members enjoyed monthly BBQs, skill-sharing sessions, think tanks, and meet-ups. Most events were free for members, attracting individuals from diverse backgrounds, including tech startups, social entrepreneurs, filmmakers, writers, and marketing professionals [\[8\]](https://hubud.org/community/).

> "Dojo Coworking is really about our people, it's about a highly motivated international & local community learning and collaborating, it's not about fancy buildings (although they are nice), or how big the coworking space is, or how fast the internet connection is, it's about real lasting human connections and moments." – Dojo Bali [\[2\]](https://dojobali.org/)

## Community Results

### Business Success Stories

One of the standout achievements from Hubud is the success of GO-JEK, co-founded by Michaelangelo Moran. GO-JEK revolutionized Indonesia's transportation sector by formalizing the motorcycle taxi industry. Over time, it grew into the country's first Decacorn super app, handling 100 million orders monthly and serving over 2.5 million users. By 2018, GO-JEK had expanded its reach across Southeast Asia, operating in countries like Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Coworking spaces like Dojo Bali have also sparked impactful initiatives. In 2016, members of Dojo Bali launched Merah Putih Hijau (MPH) to tackle Bali's waste management issues [\[4\]](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-dojo-bali-is-empowering-digital-nomads-and-the_b_5872f10ce4b0a5e600a78c64). MPH has since established key infrastructure, including a recycling and composting facility in Pererenan Village [\[11\]](https://dojobali.org/social-impact/). These successes have strengthened connections between coworking spaces and the local community.

### Local Community Connection

Both Hubud and Dojo Bali have created bridges between digital nomads and local communities through their Cogiving programs. These programs have made a difference across various sectors:

| Organization | Impact Area | Achievement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [The Spring School](https://www.facebook.com/p/The-Spring-School-Ubud-100057355873290/) | Education | Developed a website that increased enrollment |
| [Bye Bye Plastic Bags](https://byebyeplasticbags.org/) | Environmental | Youth-led campaign to eliminate plastic bags |
| [Five Pillar Foundation](https://www.mayoresort.com/five-pillar-foundation-2/) | Community Development | Village development initiatives |
| [Stella's Child](https://www.stellaschild.org/) | Youth Employment | Career preparation for disadvantaged youth |

> "I felt really lucky to have the support of Hubud's Cogiving program. Through the program, a new website has been created for The Spring School, and I hope this will help in bringing more enrollments to the school." - Veronika Nariswari [\[10\]](https://hubud.org/socialimpact/)

### Member Stories

The coworking spaces also shine through the personal experiences of their members. Project Manager Merav Knafo, Founder and CEO of [iJoomla](https://www.ijoomla.com/), shared:

> "The best part of this for me, other than helping a local business, was that all team members learned new skills, like how to work in a collaborative environment using Trello, Google docs and Facebook secret groups, and how to project manage, which is a really valuable skill to have." [\[10\]](https://hubud.org/socialimpact/)

Dojo Bali’s mission to foster meaningful relationships is rooted in its founder Michael Craig’s vision:

> "One of the fundamental reasons our founder Michael Craig started Dojo was his desire to build a community & business that had purpose behind it. He believes that through creating a community of like-minded, talented individuals there is scope for positive change which can impact the wider global community." [\[11\]](https://dojobali.org/social-impact/)

With Canggu ranked 7th globally as a top spot for digital nomads and an affordable monthly living cost of $952, Bali has become a favored destination for remote workers [\[4\]](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-dojo-bali-is-empowering-digital-nomads-and-the_b_5872f10ce4b0a5e600a78c64). These coworking spaces have not only supported digital nomads but also contributed to the local community, creating a thriving ecosystem for everyone involved.

## Current Developments

### Service Updates

Hubud now offers over 30 events every month. These include brainstorming sessions, skill-sharing talks, networking opportunities, and even yoga classes. Members can also suggest and lead discussions based on their own expertise [\[12\]](https://medium.com/coworking-coffee/coworking-coffee-break-1-hubud-c29beaf12520).

In January 2015, Hubud hosted Asia's first coworking unconference, attracting more than 135 participants from across the region [\[12\]](https://medium.com/coworking-coffee/coworking-coffee-break-1-hubud-c29beaf12520).

### Community Practices

Dojo Bali has developed a strategy that prioritizes a strong sense of belonging among its members. This focus on connection goes hand-in-hand with helping members boost their productivity [\[13\]](https://dojobali.org/community/).

> "Our community hub is a place where people connect in Canggu. This gives our members a sense of belonging that is intangible. This invisible asset enables everyone to focus on their latest projects, increase productivity, find more balance, and connect to some amazing people while exploring the magical island of Bali." - Dojo Bali [\[13\]](https://dojobali.org/community/)

### Managing Growth

Both Hubud and Dojo Bali are emphasizing community-driven growth as they expand. Hubud's Community Manager, Sisie, highlights how sharing skills and experiences fosters open collaboration, transforming not just work habits but also perspectives on balancing work and life [\[12\]](https://medium.com/coworking-coffee/coworking-coffee-break-1-hubud-c29beaf12520).

Dojo Bali continues to build on this approach with their guiding principle: "Collaboration not competition & participation over observation" [\[2\]](https://dojobali.org/). This focus on collaboration strengthens the community ethos that both spaces have cultivated through their events and programs.

## Conclusion

### Long-term Impact

Hubud and Dojo Bali were more than just coworking spaces - they transformed Bali's [digital nomad scene](https://www.nomadgossip.com/nomad-events). As Michael Craig puts it:

> "Hubud, Bali's first coworking space, not only created an amazing community, it has changed the lives of many from all around the world – entrepreneurs, location independent, digital nomads, remote workers and many more who were looking for a different way of working, learning and living. It not only created an ecosystem here in Bali but became an inspiration for coworking spaces globally. It has defined what coworking and community is." [\[14\]](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mintoxmike_coworking-dojobali-hubud-activity-6508281854313975808-ydcp)

These spaces did more than build communities; they established Bali as a go-to destination for remote workers. Their influence is now shaping property designs and hybrid workspace concepts across the island.

### What's Next for Bali Coworking

Bali's coworking landscape is set to evolve even further, driven by two key trends:

-   **Changing Property Designs**: Inspired by the success of Hubud and Dojo Bali, property owners are rethinking their spaces. They're prioritizing features like high-speed internet, private outdoor work areas, wellness facilities, and options for long-term stays [\[15\]](https://betterplace.cc/blog/remote-work-trend-shaping-balis-rental-property-market).
    
-   **Hybrid Workspaces**: The coworking model is expanding to include spaces that combine living and working areas, wellness amenities, and designs that foster community [\[15\]](https://betterplace.cc/blog/remote-work-trend-shaping-balis-rental-property-market).
    

These changes are supported by Indonesian government efforts to attract more remote workers [\[16\]](https://thebalisun.com/bali-co-working-spaces-inspire-new-generation-of-remote-workers/). Hubud and Dojo Bali's legacy continues to influence new coworking spaces, ensuring Bali remains a leader in the global remote work movement.
