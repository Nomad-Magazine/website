Remote copywriting is a flexible career that doesn’t require prior experience or formal qualifications to start. Here’s how you can begin:

-   **Learn the Basics**: Focus on skills like audience research, benefit-focused writing, and creating clear calls-to-action. Tools like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) can help refine your writing.
-   **Build a Portfolio**: Create sample projects such as product descriptions, email campaigns, and landing pages. Use platforms like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/website-builder/) or [Clippings.me](https://www.clippings.me/) to showcase your work.
-   **Start Small**: Look for entry-level gigs on platforms like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), and [Writers Work](https://writers.work/). Begin with simple tasks like writing social media captions or short blog posts.
-   **Network**: Join writing groups, attend online events, and reach out to potential clients directly to grow your connections.

**Quick Tip**: Tailor your job applications and portfolio to each opportunity, focusing on relevant skills and writing samples.

## Learn Basic Copywriting Skills

Get the basics down to kickstart your remote copywriting journey.

### Study Copywriting Fundamentals

To succeed in copywriting, you need to understand your audience inside and out. As Mark Everett Johnson, a well-known copywriter, puts it:

> Learn all you can about people and what makes them tick. You are not in the business of writing words... you are in the business of motivating human beings to take action. [\[4\]](https://www.awai.com/what-is-copywriting/copywriting-basics/)

Here are some key skills to focus on:

| Fundamental Skill | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Audience Research** | Helps you craft messages that resonate with specific groups. |
| **Benefit-Focused Writing** | Turns product features into reasons customers should care. |
| **Headline Creation** | Grabs attention and encourages people to keep reading. |
| **Clear Call-to-Action** | Directs readers toward taking the next step you want them to. |

Once you’ve got these basics, start experimenting with different types of copy to broaden your expertise.

### Write Different Copy Types

Set up your own "Copywriting Playground" to practice creating various formats. Work on mock projects that mimic real-world client needs.

Here’s how to get started:

-   Rewrite existing ads to make them more engaging.
-   Develop product descriptions for everyday items.
-   Create email campaigns for imaginary businesses.
-   Write website copy tailored to different industries.

Calvin Klein’s approach to advertising aligns with this hands-on practice:

Pair this practice with tools that can refine your work.

### Use Writing Tools

The right tools can boost both the quality of your copy and your efficiency:

| Tool | Purpose | Pricing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Grammarly** | Checks grammar and style | Free basic version |
| **Hemingway Editor** | Improves readability | One-time payment |
| **Google Docs** | Writing and collaboration | Free |
| **Headline Analyzer** | Optimizes headlines | Free basic version |

The Copywriter Club emphasizes the importance of tools like [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) for gathering customer feedback and testimonials as of 2023 [\[5\]](https://thecopywriterclub.com/free-tools-copywriters-content-writers/). These resources can help take your copy to the next level.

## Build Your First Portfolio

Show off your copywriting skills by creating a portfolio that highlights your abilities.

### Create Sample Projects

Work on mock projects that mimic real-world copywriting tasks. Start by defining key brand elements in a clear, structured way:

| Brand Element | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Core mission | Sustainable activewear for outdoor enthusiasts |
| Value Proposition | Unique benefit | Premium eco-friendly gear that lasts |
| Brand Voice | Communication style | Adventurous, eco-conscious, approachable |
| Target Audience | Ideal customer | Active millennials concerned about the environment |

Once you’ve outlined the brand, create a variety of sample content. This could include landing pages, product descriptions, email campaigns, social media posts, and digital ads.

### Set Up Your Website

Pick a platform that’s easy to use but still offers the features you need:

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Best Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WordPress | From $4 | Highly customizable, great for blogs |
| Journo Portfolio | From $8 | Simple design, unlimited articles |
| Clippings.me | $9.99 | Quick setup, professional templates |

If you’re in a hurry, you can even use a Google Docs portfolio, as shown by copywriter Ben Wise [\[6\]](https://copywritingcourse.com/copywriting-portfolio). Once your portfolio is live, it’s time to gain practical experience.

### Get Initial Experience

Pair your portfolio and website with real-world projects to showcase your growing skills.

Here’s how to get started:

-   **Volunteer Work**  
    Offer your copywriting services to local non-profits or small businesses. This is a great way to gain experience and collect published samples.
    
-   **Personal Publishing**  
    Share your writing on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or LinkedIn. Focus on topics within your niche to keep your portfolio relevant and up-to-date.
    
-   **Mock Projects**  
    Create speculative campaigns for well-known brands. Be sure to label them as mock projects to demonstrate your adaptability and creativity.
    

Once you’ve gathered a mix of samples, organize your portfolio to emphasize versatility and results.

## Find Entry-Level Jobs

Once your portfolio is ready, it's time to look for your first remote copywriting opportunities.

### Join Freelance Sites

Consider starting on freelance platforms to get your foot in the door:

| Platform | Fee Structure | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upwork | 20% on the first $500 per client | Building long-term client relationships |
| Fiverr | Flat 20% on all earnings | Offering quick, packaged services |
| Writers Work | One-time $47 fee | Accessing jobs and building your portfolio |

Make sure your profile highlights your beginner-level skills. Start with smaller, easier projects to gain confidence and strengthen your portfolio.

### Begin with Small Projects

Many remote entry-level copywriting roles, such as English Copywriter or Associate Copywriter, are posted regularly. To get started, focus on simpler tasks like:

-   Product descriptions (100-200 words)
-   Social media captions
-   Short blog posts
-   Email newsletters
-   Website content updates

Freelance platforms are great for quick gigs, but job boards can help you find more stable positions.

### Check Job Boards

Platforms like [Working Nomads](https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs) and [Remote Rocketship](https://www.remoterocketship.com/) frequently list entry-level remote copywriting jobs [\[2\]](https://www.workingnomads.com/remote-copywriting-jobs)[\[3\]](https://www.remoterocketship.com/jobs/junior-copywriter). These boards provide verified remote roles, salary details, experience requirements, and daily updates.

## Write Strong Job Applications

Once your portfolio is ready, your job application needs to clearly communicate your skills to potential clients. Use these strategies to create applications that stand out and demonstrate your ability to deliver results.

### Highlight Relevant Skills

Focus on measurable successes from your past roles that reflect your writing and communication abilities. For instance, include specific outcomes - like increased engagement or conversions - that illustrate how your work has made an impact.

### Personalize Every Application

Tailor each application to the job by incorporating keywords from the job description, mirroring the company's tone, and emphasizing the skills they’re looking for. This approach shows clients you’ve taken the time to understand their needs and can adjust your style to match.

### Pick the Right Samples

Choose writing samples that best align with the job requirements. Ideally, these should be recent (no older than four years) and demonstrate your range of skills. For entry-level positions, consider including examples like blog posts (to showcase SEO and writing skills), email copy (to highlight persuasive writing), social media posts (to show concise messaging), or landing pages (to demonstrate conversion-focused content).

## Build Professional Networks

Once your portfolio and applications are ready, it’s time to focus on building connections within the industry. Networking is a key step in finding remote copywriting jobs. Here are some practical ways to connect with potential clients and fellow writers, enhancing the work you've already done on your skills and portfolio.

### Join Writing Groups

Online writing communities are great places to learn from experienced professionals and uncover job opportunities. Platforms like LinkedIn Groups dedicated to copywriting and content marketing allow you to engage in meaningful discussions about writing techniques and industry trends.

> "Use The Web. Use it for anything you can - writers groups, feedback, networking, finding out how things work, getting published. It exists: take advantage of it." - Neil Gaiman [\[8\]](https://writingcooperative.com/networking-as-a-new-writer-from-the-comfort-of-your-couch-125f074dd213?gi=35cee84a72df&source=post_internal_links---------2----------------------------)

The impact of online writing communities is clear. For example, [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) brought together 455,080 writers in 2019 [\[8\]](https://writingcooperative.com/networking-as-a-new-writer-from-the-comfort-of-your-couch-125f074dd213?gi=35cee84a72df&source=post_internal_links---------2----------------------------). This shows just how much potential there is to connect with other writers through digital platforms.

### Join Online Events

Virtual events are another excellent way to grow your professional circle. To make the most of these opportunities:

-   Research the speakers and attendees beforehand.
-   Prepare a concise introduction that highlights your copywriting focus.
-   Take notes on key points and potential follow-ups.
-   Actively participate in chat discussions and Q&A sessions.

Websites like Meetup.com can help you find copywriting workshops, webinars, and industry conferences. Many of these events are either free or very affordable, making them accessible networking opportunities.

### Contact Potential Clients

Reaching out to potential clients directly can also open doors. Here's how to approach this effectively:

-   **Identify Your Target Audience**: Look for companies that match your writing interests and expertise. LinkedIn is a great tool for finding decision-makers in marketing or content-related roles.
-   **Craft Personalized Messages**: Tailor your outreach to show you understand their business. Reference recent projects or content to make your message stand out.
-   **Offer Value First**: Share useful industry insights or suggest ways they could enhance their existing content.

These strategies will help you build meaningful connections and set the stage for future opportunities.

## Conclusion

### Main Points

Pursuing a remote copywriting career is entirely possible with the right mindset and strategy. Copywriting is a skill you can develop without a formal degree. The key is your commitment to learning and your ability to showcase your skills effectively. With these basics in place, you're ready to take actionable steps toward your goal.
