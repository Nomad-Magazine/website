## 1\. [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)

Airbnb has expanded its offerings to better cater to digital nomads, providing options like long-term stays (28+ days), monthly payment plans, and discounts from hosts [\[2\]](https://touchstay.com/blog/should-you-do-long-term-airbnb-rentals). However, finding affordable options can be tricky, as many hosts have increased prices due to rising demand [\[4\]](https://medium.com/@artofnomading.travel/how-to-find-affordable-accomodation-as-a-digital-nomad-not-booking-through-airbnb-59949fe44bab).

For instance, in 2022, renting a local one-bedroom apartment in cities like Budapest, Porto, or Barcelona cost around $500–$810 per month. In contrast, similar Airbnb listings ranged from $2,000 to over $3,200 [\[4\]](https://medium.com/@artofnomading.travel/how-to-find-affordable-accomodation-as-a-digital-nomad-not-booking-through-airbnb-59949fe44bab).

To find work-friendly spaces on Airbnb, make use of its search filters. You can select the _'Dedicated workspace'_ filter, check verified Wi-Fi speeds, and look for amenities like a fully equipped kitchen, TV, and free parking [\[5\]](https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-to-make-your-space-comfortable-for-remote-workers-236)[\[6\]](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/479).

In the UK, Airbnb stays average $1,009 per month, including utilities, which is lower than the typical cost of $1,737 for traditional rentals [\[3\]](https://remotebase.co/p/nomad-accommodation-airbnb-or-renting). Here's an example cost breakdown:

| Expense Category | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Accommodation | $800 |
| Transportation | $135 |
| Travel Insurance | $7  |
| **Total** | **$1,009** |

To make the most of Airbnb as a digital nomad, try these tips:

-   Look for discounts on monthly stays.
    
-   Compare Airbnb prices with local rental markets.
    
-   Carefully analyze workspace photos and descriptions.
    
-   Check Wi-Fi speeds through guest reviews.
    

That said, some digital nomads have reported issues like inconsistent workspace setups and cleanliness [\[1\]](https://www.outsite.co/articles/digital-nomad-living-housing). If you want a more dependable experience with dedicated workspaces, platforms like Outsite might be worth considering [\[1\]](https://www.outsite.co/articles/digital-nomad-living-housing).

These approaches can help digital nomads navigate Airbnb's pricing and find accommodations that meet their work and lifestyle needs.

## 2\. [Flatio](https://www.flatio.com/?af=nomadgossipmagazine)

Flatio is a top choice for digital nomads seeking mid-term rentals, offering stays ranging from 1 to 12 months. With a TrustScore of 4.5 and a 4.7 rating on Trustpilot [\[7\]](https://www.flatio.com/)[\[8\]](https://remotelyserious.com/short-term-rental-sites-for-digital-nomads/), it’s designed to meet the unique needs of remote workers.

Unlike platforms like Airbnb, Flatio focuses specifically on mid-term rentals. It offers **deposit-free bookings** and includes utilities in the rental price. Plus, every listing comes with a lease that can serve as proof of address for visa applications [\[8\]](https://remotelyserious.com/short-term-rental-sites-for-digital-nomads/)[\[9\]](https://www.flatio.com/blog/how-to-choose-an-accommodation-as-a-digital-nomad).

In April 2024, Flatio launched the "Verified by Nomad Inspector" badge. This program involves digital nomad influencers who assess properties based on specific criteria:

| **Verification Criteria** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace Setup | Ergonomic furniture, accessible power outlets |
| Internet Quality | Reliable Wi-Fi with adequate speed |
| Location Suitability | Close to essential amenities |

Flatio also provides **StayProtection**, which includes:

-   A move-in guarantee
    
-   Liability insurance
    
-   24/7 online support
    
-   Assistance for covered situations [\[7\]](https://www.flatio.com/)
    

One of Flatio’s standout features is its commitment to work-ready spaces and community-driven ratings, unlike Airbnb’s more variable setups [\[10\]](https://myvegantravels.com/travel-tips/digital-nomad-accommodation-sites/). Both tenants and landlords review each other, creating a system of accountability and trust [\[8\]](https://remotelyserious.com/short-term-rental-sites-for-digital-nomads/). This is especially valuable, as 30% of digital nomads report that a lack of community is their biggest challenge in maintaining happiness while working remotely [\[11\]](https://www.flatio.com/blog/5-innovative-features-your-digital-nomad-rental-should-offer). Flatio’s emphasis on quality and connection helps address this gap.

To get the most out of Flatio, look for listings marked as "Accommodation for digital nomads" [\[7\]](https://www.flatio.com/). These properties are typically equipped with essentials like fast internet and dedicated workspaces, making them ideal for productive remote work.

## 3\. [Outsite](https://www.outsite.co/locations)

Outsite is a coliving platform tailored for remote professionals, offering over 50 locations and a community of 4,000 members [\[13\]](https://duracatravels.com/outsite-review/).

All properties come with dependable WiFi, ergonomic workspaces, and professional cleaning services [\[14\]](https://www.outsite.co/).

Outsite also prioritizes community engagement with weekly events and inviting shared spaces.

## 4\. [Nomad Stays](https://www.nomadstays.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoraciRUJQQvTlZVYWSSQ4DRouV3F800rVQLlM3elCjFBJ9LLuPU)

Nomad Stays is a platform designed specifically for remote professionals, offering properties in over 80 countries that meet strict remote work standards.

The platform operates on a "Full Payment" system, requiring guests to pay upfront along with a $39 application fee. Payments go directly to hosts, often resulting in more competitive pricing for long-term stays [\[17\]](https://www.nomadstays.com/how-it-works). A minimum stay of 7 nights is required, with the average booking lasting 26.8 nights [\[17\]](https://www.nomadstays.com/how-it-works). This setup makes Nomad Stays an appealing choice for extended stays.

To get the most out of Nomad Stays, keep these tips in mind:

-   **Longer stays**: Properties often offer better rates for extended bookings.
    
-   **Location matters**: Look for places near coworking spaces or [digital nomad communities](https://www.nomadgossip.com/nomad_directory).
    
-   **Tech amenities**: Check the specific tech features listed for each property.
    
-   **Visa check**: Research the [remote work visa options](https://www.nomadgossip.com/blog/remote-work-visas-top-10-countries-for-digital-nomads) for your chosen destination.
    

The platform has become popular in emerging digital nomad hotspots across Europe and Asia, with listings in countries like Portugal, Thailand, and Georgia. These destinations have recently updated their visa policies to attract remote workers.

## How to Pick the Right Digital Nomad Housing

Finding the right place to stay as a digital nomad is all about balancing your work needs with your lifestyle preferences. With the number of digital nomads jumping from 7.3 million in 2019 to 16.9 million in 2022 [\[35\]](https://sparkmap.org/choosing-locations-as-a-digital-nomad/), choosing the right housing can make or break your remote work experience.

### Key Factors for a Productive Work Setup

A good workspace is essential for staying productive. Here’s what to prioritize:

-   **Fast and reliable internet**: Aim for at least 50 Mbps for smooth video calls and quick file uploads [\[37\]](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3003).
    
-   **Dedicated workspace**: Look for a proper desk and an ergonomic chair to avoid discomfort.
    
-   **Natural lighting**: Helps reduce eye strain and keeps you focused throughout the day.
    

Before booking, check Wi-Fi speeds. Use Airbnb’s speed verification feature [\[38\]](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/airbnbs-new-speed-test-feature-lets-you-check-the-wi-fi-before-you-book/) or tools like [BroadbandNow](https://broadbandnow.com/speedtest) if needed [\[39\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/07/how-check-internet-reliability-before-moving/).

### Budgeting and Choosing the Right Location

Take advantage of geoarbitrage - earning in high-income markets while living in more affordable destinations [\[35\]](https://sparkmap.org/choosing-locations-as-a-digital-nomad/). Here’s a comparison of costs in popular digital nomad hotspots:

| Location | Average Rent | Total Monthly Budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vietnam | $300 | $500–700 |
| Mexico | $500 | $800–1,000 |
| Portugal | $700 | $1,000–1,500 |
| Medellín | $400 | $700–900 |
| Chiang Mai | $300 | $700–1,000 |

While rent is a big part of your budget, also consider safety, access to amenities, and how well-connected the area is.

### Safety and Community: What to Look For

Feeling safe and having a sense of community can make your stay much more enjoyable. Here’s how to assess these factors:

-   **Learn About the Neighborhood**: Look into safety, nearby amenities, and public transport. Joining digital nomad Facebook groups can give you valuable firsthand tips [\[36\]](https://aicontentfy.com/en/blog/finding-perfect-digital-nomad-housing-tips-and-tricks).
    
-   **Start with a Short-Term Stay**: Book a place for a short period to test things like internet speed, noise levels, and the surrounding community.
    
-   **Opt for Flexible Leases**: Look for month-to-month contracts with clear cancellation policies and included utilities.
    

### Checklist for Evaluating a Property

Before signing any lease, go through this checklist:

-   Test internet speeds with tools like [Fast.com](https://fast.com/) or [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/) [\[39\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/07/how-check-internet-reliability-before-moving/), and confirm backup options.
    
-   Check for building security features.
    
-   Ensure access to essential amenities.
    
-   Read tenant reviews for insights.
    
-   Confirm the quality of the desk and chair.
    
-   Review lease terms carefully.
    

A well-chosen place can significantly improve your work-life balance. As Airbnb emphasizes:

> "As the growing flexibility to work and live from anywhere continues, being able to determine a listing's Wi‑Fi speed before booking is a must‑have for digital nomads, remote workers, roadschoolers, traveling families, gamers, and creatives alike.
