## How [Roamless](https://roamless.com/) eSIM Cuts Roaming Costs

### Issues with Traditional Roaming

Using traditional roaming services often results in hefty bills due to high per-minute charges, per-message fees, and daily access costs. These fees can quickly add up, making international travel unnecessarily expensive.

### How Roamless eSIM Connects Locally

Roamless eSIM connects directly to local network providers in **195 destinations** [\[1\]](https://roamless.com/). Instead of relying on your home carrier, it automatically detects and registers with local networks. If one network's signal weakens, your device can switch to another partner network effortlessly [\[3\]](https://roamless.com/features/seamless-global-connectivity).

To ensure smooth connectivity, keep 'Data Roaming' enabled on your Roamless eSIM while disabling it on your primary SIM. If you experience any issues, toggling Airplane mode briefly can help re-establish the connection [\[4\]](https://roamless.com/how-to-setup-your-esim)[\[5\]](https://roamless.com/help). This setup not only ensures better network quality but also helps you avoid unnecessary roaming charges.

### How Roamless eSIM Saves Money

Roamless eSIM’s pay-as-you-go model means you’re only charged for the data you actually use [\[1\]](https://roamless.com/). For example, in January 2025, a user in Morocco spent just a few dollars for 500MB of data [\[6\]](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/01/review-roamless-travel-esim/).

Here’s what Roamless eSIM offers:

-   **Full-speed internet** with no artificial speed limits [\[7\]](https://roamless.com/blog/roaming-charges-in-the-usa)
-   **No daily fees** or mandatory data packages

Roamless eSIM is designed to keep you connected without breaking the bank, making it an excellent choice for frequent travelers and digital nomads alike.

## Installing Roamless eSIM

### Device Support Check

To use Roamless eSIM, make sure your device supports eSIM technology. Most smartphones released since 2018 are compatible. Here's how to check:

**For [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone)**:

-   Go to **Settings > General > About**.
-   Look for 'Available SIM' (for iOS 15 or later) or 'Digital SIM' (for older versions).

| [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/) | **Settings > Connections > SIM Card Manager** > Check for "Add Mobile Plan" |
| [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) | **Settings > About Phone > Show EID** > Look for the EID number |
| Other Android | Dial **\*#06#** to see if an EID is displayed |

### Setup Instructions

Before starting, ensure you're connected to a stable WiFi network and airplane mode is turned off. Then, follow these steps:

1.  **Activate the eSIM**  
    Open the Roamless app, click **"Activate Now"**, and follow the prompts until you see **"Cellular Setup Complete"**.
    
2.  **Set Default Preferences**  
    Adjust these settings:

**For iPhone Users**:
