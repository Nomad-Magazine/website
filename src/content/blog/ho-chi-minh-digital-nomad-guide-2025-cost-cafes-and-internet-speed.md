## Legal Requirements

If you're planning to work as a digital nomad in Ho Chi Minh City, it's essential to understand Vietnam's legal requirements.

### Visa Options

Vietnam doesn't offer a specific [digital nomad visa](https://www.nomadgossip.com/blog/remote-work-visas-top-10-countries-for-digital-nomads), but you can choose from these alternatives:

| Visa Type | Duration | Cost | Processing Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **E-visa** | 30 days | $25 | 3 working days |
| **Visa on Arrival** | 90 days | $56–$100 total\* | 2–4 working days |
| **Tourist Visa** | 15–90 days | $40–$80 | Varies by embassy |

\*The total cost for Visa on Arrival includes an online application fee ($6–$50) and a $50 stamping fee.

The **Visa on Arrival** provides the most flexibility, but it’s only available if you’re arriving by air. For this visa, you'll need:

-   A valid passport with at least 6 months of validity
-   A completed visa application form
-   A visa approval letter
-   An entry/exit form
-   Passport photos
-   Cash for the stamping fee

If you’re entering Vietnam by land, you’ll need to apply for a visa through an embassy.

### Tax Rules

Your tax responsibilities in Vietnam depend on your residency status and where your income originates.

**Tax Resident Status**  
You’re considered a tax resident if:

-   You stay in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a calendar year.
-   You maintain a permanent residence in the country.

**Non-Residents**  
If your stay is under 183 days, you’ll face a flat 20% tax on income earned within Vietnam [\[2\]](https://www.cabinzero.com/blogs/digital-nomad/digital-nomad-vietnam).

**Important Notes:**

-   Working while on a tourist visa or visa exemption is against the law.
-   Income earned outside of Vietnam is generally not taxed.
-   For stays longer than 3 months, you should apply for a business visa or extend your visa through local travel agencies (additional fees may apply).

_Tip:_ If you’re staying for more than six months or working with Vietnamese companies, it’s a good idea to consult a local tax expert to ensure you’re meeting all legal obligations.
