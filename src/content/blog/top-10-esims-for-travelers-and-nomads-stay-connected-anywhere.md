## How to Pick the Right eSIM

Here’s what to consider when choosing an eSIM that works for you.

Most providers claim coverage in 150–200+ countries [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/). However, network quality can vary. Check country-specific coverage maps and partner networks - urban areas typically offer stronger signals compared to rural locations.

Plans start as low as $0.98 with BNESIM [\[2\]](https://affmaven.com/esims-international-travel/) and go up to $6.90 for unlimited data with providers like Holafly [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/). Think about your needs: a light plan may work for short trips, but if you’re a heavy user, an unlimited plan might be better.

Beyond price, pay attention to features that improve connectivity while traveling. Some providers offer mobile hotspot options (e.g., Yesim [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/)), built-in security tools like VPN and ad blocking (e.g., Saily [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/)), and flexible top-up options (e.g., Gigsky [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/)).

Pick a plan that matches how you use data. Activities like navigation, video calls, and syncing require more data. If you rely heavily on mobile data, go for a higher-capacity or unlimited plan.

Look for providers with apps that make things easier. Features like real-time data tracking, simple plan management, quick support, and easy eSIM installation can make a big difference [\[2\]](https://affmaven.com/esims-international-travel/).

Some providers also offer extra perks. For example, aloSIM gives you a free international number for calls and texts [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/), while Roamless offers a pay-as-you-go model with international calling through its app [\[1\]](https://thenomadalmanac.com/esims-for-international-travel/).

During the first few days of your trip, keep an eye on your data usage to ensure your plan meets your needs. Many providers let you upgrade your plan easily if needed, though downgrading mid-plan is less common.
