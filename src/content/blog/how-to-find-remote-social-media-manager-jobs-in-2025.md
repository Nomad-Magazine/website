### Core Social Media Management Skills

To excel in social media management, you need to master the skills that drive engagement and deliver results. Meghan Keaney Anderson, VP of Marketing at [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/), highlights the importance of staying ahead:

> "We really look for people with their finger on the pulse of how social is changing. It is one of the most rapidly changing industries right now, and I want someone who is paying attention to it, who is enthralled by it and fascinated by it. … Things shift so fast. If you think about the social media channels that were dominant two years ago and the social media channels that are dominant today, it's just a totally different world."

With users spending an average of 2 hours and 27 minutes daily on social media [\[1\]](https://www.mayple.com/resources/social-media-marketing/social-media-manager-skills), mastering these skills is essential:

## Creating Your Professional Online Presence

### LinkedIn Profile Setup for Remote Jobs

Profiles with photos get **21 times more views** and **9 times more connection requests** than those without them [\[6\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-optimize-linkedin-profile-2023-step-by-step-guide-arno-fvm5e).

To further optimize your profile:

-   Create a first-person summary (under 2,000 characters) that effectively tells your professional story.
-   List up to 50 relevant skills, prioritizing those that are most sought after in social media management.

### Building Your Work Portfolio

A well-curated portfolio complements your LinkedIn profile and showcases your expertise. Include these key elements:

Scarlett Mansfield’s portfolio is another great example, addressing client pain points while presenting detailed campaign stats [\[7\]](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/digital-marketing/social-media-portfolio/).

### Managing Professional Social Media Accounts

Your online presence isn’t just about your profiles - it’s also about how you manage your social media accounts. Here’s how to reinforce your professional brand:

## Job Search Resources and Platforms

Once your professional online presence is polished, it’s time to explore resources tailored to remote social media management roles.

### Remote Work Job Boards

Platforms like Remote.co are great for finding remote social media management jobs at various experience levels. These specialized job boards can help you identify roles that match your skills and career aspirations.

### Online Communities and Networks

Take advantage of industry-specific platforms and online communities to discover opportunities you might not find elsewhere. Engaging in discussions, joining relevant groups, and connecting with peers can open doors to remote roles and help you stay informed about new openings in the field. Building these relationships can be just as important as submitting applications.

## Job Application Steps and Tips

### Writing a Remote Work Resume

Your resume should highlight both your ability to work remotely and your expertise in social media. Focus on measurable results to clearly show your contributions. For example, instead of saying "managed social media accounts", say "increased Instagram engagement by 45% using data-driven strategies."

Key skills to emphasize include:

| Technical Skills | Remote Work Skills |
| --- | --- |
| Social Media Management Platforms | Virtual Communication |
| Analytics Tools | Time Management |
| Content Creation Software | Self-motivation |
| Campaign Management | Project Organization |
| Scheduling Tools | Digital Collaboration |

> "Be self-aware of the way you work, your strengths, etc. If you're not, you have a world of hurt ahead of you. If you tell someone what they think they want to hear instead of what's true, you're setting yourself up for tremendous hurt and friction."  
> – Shala Burroughs, Co-Founder of [CloudPeeps](https://www.betterteam.com/cloudpeeps) [\[8\]](https://skillcrush.com/blog/remote-job-interview-questions/)

### Remote Interview Preparation

Set up a professional virtual interview space with good lighting, a tidy background, and equipment that's been tested in advance. Be ready to share detailed examples of campaigns you've worked on, focusing on your strategies and results. As Leslie Zaikis, Director of Sales and Marketing at Skillcrush, explains, "email for confirming deadlines and schedules, chat for quick questions, and video hangouts for meetings and brainstorming" [\[8\]](https://skillcrush.com/blog/remote-job-interview-questions/).

Prepare to discuss:

-   Your home office setup and daily routine
-   Familiarity with remote collaboration tools
-   Techniques for managing your time effectively
-   Examples of self-directed projects you've completed

### Remote Job Salary Discussions

Once you've polished your resume and impressed during interviews, it's time to discuss salary. Research current market rates using tools like [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/) or [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm). Look beyond the base salary and consider the full compensation package, which might include:

-   Base salary
-   Performance bonuses
-   Remote work stipend
-   Funds for professional development
-   Health benefits
-   Flexible scheduling
-   Stock options

Let the employer make the first offer. When negotiating, focus on your accomplishments and skills that make you stand out. For instance, if you've improved social media conversion rates or managed multiple high-profile accounts, use these as examples to support your case.

> "Negotiating your salary doesn't have to be intimidating. With solid research, the right tools, and a clear strategy, you can secure the appropriate compensation." [\[9\]](https://www.careerist.com/insights/10-tips-to-negotiate-your-salary-in-2025-maximize-your-pay-and-growth)

## Conclusion: Next Steps for Job Seekers

Landing a remote social media manager role in 2025 takes planning and skill development. A good starting point is using LinkedIn's "Open To Work" feature to discreetly let recruiters know you're available [\[11\]](https://www.linkedin.com). As Alison Battisby from Avocado Social highlights:

> "The most valuable skill for a social media manager is video creation and editing. Being able to shoot, edit, and craft a compelling story that grabs attention in the first few seconds with a great hook and keeps viewers engaged is key to success" [\[10\]](https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/what-skills-do-i-need-to-be-a-social-media-manager).

Take inspiration from Sophia Valdez, who increased her salary from $55,000 to $150,000 by expanding her network and using her transferable skills in remote roles. Her journey emphasizes the importance of understanding your value and growing professional connections.
