**[Remote Year](https://www.remoteyear.com/), a popular program for digital nomads, abruptly shut down in December 2024, leaving members and the remote work community in shock.** Here's what you need to know:

-   **What Happened?** Remote Year, founded in 2014, offered structured travel and work experiences but faced financial challenges after being acquired by [Selina](https://www.selina.com/) in 2020. [Selina](https://www.selina.com/)'s insolvency in July 2024 and subsequent acquisition by [Collective Hospitality](https://www.collective-hospitality.com/) led to the program's closure.
-   **Who’s Affected?** Members lost deposits, travel credits, and access to accommodations and coworking spaces. Vendors and staff were also impacted.
-   **What’s Next?** Programs like [Noma Collective](https://www.noma-collective.com/) and [Pangea](https://www.thepangea.app/) are stepping in with support for displaced members. Digital nomads are now shifting toward independent and flexible travel options.

**Key Takeaway:** Remote Year’s closure highlights the risks of relying on structured travel programs, emphasizing the importance of financial planning, diversified travel arrangements, and self-reliant nomadic lifestyles.

## [Remote Year](https://www.remoteyear.com/): From Start to Shutdown

### Company Background

Founded in 2014 by Greg Caplan and Sam Pessin, Remote Year aimed to combine remote work with international travel. The company charged participants between $2,000 and $3,000 monthly for structured travel experiences [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Year). When it launched in December 2014, it generated significant interest - over 50,000 sign-ups, 3,000 inquiries within three days, and attention from 15 companies. The first group of 75 participants kicked off their journey in Prague, traveling through cities like Ljubljana, Istanbul, Penang, and Buenos Aires [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Year). These early achievements set the stage for the challenges that would eventually lead to its closure.

### Why Remote Year Closed

Remote Year faced financial challenges and ownership changes that ultimately led to its shutdown. In 2020, Selina acquired the company, intending to expand its co-working and co-living services [\[2\]](https://skift.com/2024/12/21/remote-year-shuts-down-despite-new-owners-earlier-promises-of-a-bright-future/). However, Selina's aggressive growth strategy and rising debt led to its insolvency in July 2024 [\[2\]](https://skift.com/2024/12/21/remote-year-shuts-down-despite-new-owners-earlier-promises-of-a-bright-future/).

After Selina's collapse, Collective Hospitality purchased Remote Year as part of Selina's distressed assets. Although CEO Gary Murray initially praised Remote Year as a "fabulous business", the new ownership's actions led to its closure [\[2\]](https://skift.com/2024/12/21/remote-year-shuts-down-despite-new-owners-earlier-promises-of-a-bright-future/). Here's a timeline of the critical events leading to the shutdown.

### Key Events Before Closure

| Timeline | Key Development |
| --- | --- |
| 2014 | Founded by Greg Caplan and Sam Pessin |
| Summer 2015 | First program launched with 75 participants |
| 2020 | Acquired by Selina |
| July 2024 | Selina declares insolvency |
| August 2024 | Collective Hospitality acquires Remote Year |
| December 2024 | Operations cease permanently |

## Effects on Digital Nomads

### Current Member Impact

Remote Year's sudden closure has left many members scrambling to adjust. Customers are dealing with unclear refund policies and challenges in using travel credits they had banked. For many, Remote Year's programs were the backbone of their work and travel lifestyle, so the fallout has been significant. Here’s a quick breakdown of the immediate effects:

| Impact Area | Immediate Consequences |
| --- | --- |
| Financial | Loss of deposits and unused travel credits |
| Housing | Canceled or disrupted accommodation plans |
| Work | Limited or no access to co-working spaces |
| Community | Canceled group events and activities |

This situation has also raised concerns about the reliability of such structured travel programs.

### Trust in Travel Programs

The closure has highlighted the risks tied to organized travel programs. Remote Year's journey - from independent operations to acquisitions by Selina and later Collective Hospitality - shows how corporate decisions can disrupt participants' lives. The challenges of scaling quickly in the travel and hospitality industry have become more apparent, leaving many to question the stability of these models.

### Market Changes

In the wake of Remote Year's exit, other organizations have stepped up to support displaced travelers. Groups like Noma Collective and Pangea are offering discounts and travel credits to help ease the transition, valid through January 2025 [\[1\]](https://digitalnomads.world/tips/remote-year-shuts-down-after-nearly-a-decade-leaving-digital-nomads-in-disarray). Meanwhile, some former Remote Year employees have hinted at the possibility of reviving key aspects of the program independently. This could pave the way for new, creative nomadic travel services.

These shifts are encouraging digital nomads to rethink their dependency on structured programs, with many now leaning toward more independent and flexible travel options.

## Next Steps for Digital Nomads

### Immediate Actions

Take quick steps to secure your finances and travel plans. First, reach out to your bank or credit card company to dispute any recent charges for upcoming programs. Many financial institutions have specific procedures for handling travel-related disputes.

If you have travel insurance, file a claim as soon as possible. Be sure to keep a record of all communications with Remote Year and save any payment receipts. Here's a quick guide to help prioritize your actions:

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High | Contact your bank/credit card company | Within 24–48 hours |
| High | File a travel insurance claim | Within 7 days |
| Medium | Document communications | Ongoing |
| Medium | Join local nomad groups | Within 2 weeks |
| Low | Look into alternative housing options | Within 30 days |

Once you’ve handled these immediate concerns, shift your focus to creating a stable and independent nomad lifestyle.

### Planning Your Nomad Life

Building a self-sufficient nomadic lifestyle takes intentional planning. Former Remote Year participants can benefit from transition support, with Noma Collective and Pangea offering assistance packages through January 2025 [\[1\]](https://digitalnomads.world/tips/remote-year-shuts-down-after-nearly-a-decade-leaving-digital-nomads-in-disarray).

Here are a few key areas to focus on:

-   **Housing Options**: Develop relationships with local property managers and secure extended-stay rentals in your preferred destinations. This can help you build a dependable network for accommodations.
-   **Work Setup**: Ensure you have reliable remote work tools, including backup internet solutions and portable office gear to stay productive anywhere.
-   **Community Connections**: Join local [digital nomad](https://www.nomadgossip.com/nomad-events) groups and online communities tailored to your destinations. Building these relationships before you arrive can make your transitions smoother.

Planning ahead also means sharpening personal skills to navigate challenges with confidence.

### Self-Reliant Travel Skills

Develop these essential skills to thrive as an independent traveler:

-   **Digital Organization**: Keep track of travel plans, work deadlines, and important contacts in one place.
-   **Financial Management**: Use flexible payment options and maintain an emergency fund to handle unexpected expenses.
-   **Cultural Awareness**: Learn basic phrases in local languages and research cultural norms to ease your interactions.
-   **Networking**: Build and maintain professional and social connections wherever you go.

Independent travel requires both practical know-how and emotional strength. By mastering these skills and creating a solid routine, you can balance your work commitments with meaningful experiences in every destination.

## What's Next for Digital Nomads

### New Travel Program Models

With Remote Year shutting down, new travel programs are stepping in to fill the gap. These programs now focus on shorter, more flexible options to match modern work-life demands. For instance, NomadPro's "Basecamp Treks" provides flexible schedules, multiple location choices, and guaranteed coworking spaces [\[4\]](https://nomadpro.com/). Similarly, Noma Collective offers 2-4 week curated experiences that combine work-friendly infrastructure with opportunities for community and local cultural engagement [\[5\]](https://www.noma-collective.com/).

Key highlights of these programs include:

-   Short-term commitments (2-4 weeks)
-   Reliable internet access
-   Opportunities to connect with local communities
-   Networking with professionals
-   Flexible scheduling options

### Market Growth Outlook

The rise of these new travel models reflects broader trends in the digital nomad lifestyle. Despite Remote Year’s closure, the market for digital nomads continues to expand. In the U.S., the percentage of digital nomads has grown significantly, jumping from 7.3% to 17.3% [\[6\]](https://www.digitalnomadstories.io/p/8-nomad-november-the-entrepreneurs).

### New Solutions Emerging

As the digital nomad market evolves, fresh solutions are being developed to address the changing needs of remote workers. The closure of Remote Year has prompted a wave of innovation. For example, a new collaboration between Noma Collective and [Hacker Paradise](https://www.hackerparadise.org/) demonstrates a shift toward more integrated support systems [\[5\]](https://www.noma-collective.com/).

These solutions focus on:

-   **Community Management**: Local experts to ease transitions

The market remains active and ever-changing, with new entrants building on past experiences to better serve the remote work community.

## Moving Forward

Recent challenges have highlighted the need to rethink and strengthen your nomadic lifestyle. Here are key insights and strategies to help you navigate this evolving journey.

### Main Lessons

The shutdown underscored the risks of depending on a single travel provider. Prioritize these three areas:

| Focus Area | Key Consideration | Action Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Financial Planning | Emergency Fund | Build savings to handle unexpected disruptions |
| Travel Arrangements | Diversification | Use multiple platforms for booking stays |
| Risk Management | Insurance Coverage | Get comprehensive travel insurance |

### Tips for New Nomads

-   **Check Financial Stability**: Look into a company's financial health and ownership before committing.
-   **Have Backup Resources**: Set aside funds specifically for travel-related emergencies.
-   **Be Self-Reliant**: Build direct relationships with local services and communities.

> "We deeply believe in the transformative power of travel and connection and know this is not the end of the journey for our community." - Remote Year [\[2\]](https://skift.com/2024/12/21/remote-year-shuts-down-despite-new-owners-earlier-promises-of-a-bright-future/)

### Building a Stable Nomad Life

To thrive as a digital nomad, balance independence with community ties. After Remote Year's closure, successful nomads have found stability by blending self-reliance with local connections. For instance, many collaborate with others in their destination cities to secure better accommodation deals and share helpful local tips [\[1\]](https://digitalnomads.world/tips/remote-year-shuts-down-after-nearly-a-decade-leaving-digital-nomads-in-disarray).

Here are some practices to create a more stable lifestyle:

-   Join local digital nomad groups wherever you travel.
-   Build relationships with coworking spaces and accommodation providers directly.
-   Develop professional networks that aren't tied to any single travel program.

Mastering skills like negotiating rental agreements and understanding visa requirements can help you stay adaptable. These steps ensure you're prepared for future disruptions while maintaining the flexibility that makes nomadic living so rewarding.
