-   Compatibility with the latest WiFi standards
-   Built-in signal strength indicators
-   Ethernet ports for wired devices
-   Mesh networking options for larger areas

Placing the booster properly is just as important as its features.

### Best Placement for Your Booster

Once you've chosen the right booster, setting it up in the right spot is key to getting the best performance.

-   **Find the Right Location**  
    Place your booster about halfway between your router and the area with poor coverage. Aim for a height of around 4 feet, similar to your router's placement [\[8\]](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3103/).
    
-   **Adjust for Optimal Performance**  
    Point the booster's antennas vertically toward the router. Avoid placing it near metal objects, mirrors, concrete walls, or other electronics that might interfere with the signal.
    
-   **Fine-tune the Signal**  
    Use a WiFi analyzer app to find the clearest channel for your network [\[9\]](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-boost-wifi-signal).
    

If your connectivity issues persist, consider upgrading to a mesh WiFi system [\[9\]](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-boost-wifi-signal). Keeping the booster's firmware updated and periodically adjusting channels can also help maintain strong performance [\[11\]](https://wifibooster-pro.co.uk/blogs/news/how-to-troubleshoot-common-issues-with-wifi-extenders-tips-and-solutions).
