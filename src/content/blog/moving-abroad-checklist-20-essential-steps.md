**Moving abroad? Here's everything you need to know in one place.**

Relocating internationally can be overwhelming, but this checklist simplifies the process into 20 key steps. From visas to finances, housing, and work setups, here's a quick look at what you'll need:

-   **Legal Prep**: Start visa applications early (may take 6+ months). U.S. travelers to Schengen countries will need [ETIAS](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en) from May 2025.
    
-   **Money Setup**: Open international bank accounts, plan for visa fees, housing deposits, and create a 3–6 month emergency fund.
    
-   **Housing**: Research rentals, inspect properties, and secure agreements for utilities and deposits.
    
-   **Packing**: Prioritize essentials like documents, electronics, and healthcare items. Keep shipping costs in mind.
    
-   **First Week Abroad**: Register locally, set up phone/internet, and handle banking and utilities.
    

Planning ahead ensures a smoother move. Use this guide to stay organized and make your transition stress-free.

## Before You Move

### Legal Requirements

Start by getting all your paperwork in order. The visa application process can take up to six months, so it's smart to begin early [\[4\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/moving-abroad/moving-abroad-checklist.php). Starting in May 2025, U.S. citizens traveling to Schengen countries, even for short visits, will need to apply for ETIAS authorization [\[4\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/moving-abroad/moving-abroad-checklist.php).

You'll need key documents like a valid passport, visa-related paperwork (such as employment contracts, bank statements, and health insurance), and personal records like birth or marriage certificates [\[6\]](https://www.reallymoving.com/international-removals/guides/visas-and-documents-required-to-move-abroad).

For digital nomad visas, requirements vary by country. For example, Portugal and Estonia offer specific visas that often require proof of remote employment and meeting minimum income thresholds [\[1\]](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/digital-nomad-visa/)[\[3\]](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/digital-nomad-visa).

Once your legal documents are squared away, it's time to focus on your financial preparations.

### Money Setup

Having your finances in order is essential to avoid unexpected issues. Start setting up your international banking arrangements at least two months before you move.

Open an international bank account with low fees, secure a credit card that’s widely accepted globally, and plan for initial expenses like visa fees, housing deposits, and transportation [\[4\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/moving-abroad/moving-abroad-checklist.php).

Build a detailed budget that includes:

-   Visa application costs
    
-   Housing deposits and first month's rent
    
-   An emergency fund covering 3–6 months of expenses
    
-   Healthcare costs
    
-   Transportation expenses
    

With your financial plans in place, you can shift your attention to finding a place to live.

### Finding Housing

Securing the right housing is key to settling in smoothly. Research the local rental market thoroughly to find a place that fits your needs.

Consider platforms like [Coliving.com](https://coliving.com/) for shared, community-driven spaces, [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) for temporary stays, or local real estate websites for long-term rentals [\[5\]](https://coliving.com/blog/moving-abroad-checklist-12-must-do-steps-for-expats)[\[2\]](https://www.thingsnomadsdo.com/blog/checklist-for-digital-nomads-when-arriving-at-a-new-destination).

Look for neighborhoods with reliable internet, good public transit, safety, and nearby amenities. Always inspect properties carefully and ensure you have clear agreements on deposits, utilities, and maintenance responsibilities [\[5\]](https://coliving.com/blog/moving-abroad-checklist-12-must-do-steps-for-expats)[\[2\]](https://www.thingsnomadsdo.com/blog/checklist-for-digital-nomads-when-arriving-at-a-new-destination).

## Packing and Moving

### Required Paperwork

Start organizing your essential documents about two months before your move. You'll need items like your passport (valid for at least six months beyond your stay), visa paperwork, birth and marriage certificates, medical and vaccination records, educational transcripts, tax documents, and driving permits.

Make three copies of everything:

-   **Physical copy**: Keep one set with you during travel.
    
-   **Backup copy**: Leave another set with a trusted family member.
    
-   **Digital copy**: Store a secure version in cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox [\[4\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/moving-abroad/moving-abroad-checklist.php).
    

Once your paperwork is sorted, it's time to think about the tools you'll need to maintain a smooth remote work setup.

### Work Equipment

A poorly planned work setup can disrupt your productivity and even cut your trip short. Here's what you should prioritize:

-   A dependable laptop with an extended warranty
    
-   A portable backup drive for important files
    
-   A universal power adapter suited to your destination
    
-   Noise-canceling headphones for online meetings
    
-   A portable Wi-Fi hotspot for steady internet access
    

Before you leave, research local internet providers and connection speeds at your destination. For temporary internet, check out options like [Skyroam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solis-wifi/id1411394761) or [GlocalMe](https://www.glocalme.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorHj6hoGWIpj99pUHPENMl7gjHjs4RQpAv5S4UaY6GdZ87YioJw) [\[2\]](https://www.thingsnomadsdo.com/blog/checklist-for-digital-nomads-when-arriving-at-a-new-destination)[\[3\]](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/digital-nomad-visa).

Once your work gear is ready, shift your focus to packing the rest of your belongings effectively.

### What to Pack

International shipping can cost $200–$600 per 100 pounds [\[4\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/moving-abroad/moving-abroad-checklist.php), so pack smart. Categorize your belongings:

-   **Clothing**: Pack two weeks' worth of versatile, weather-appropriate outfits.
    
-   **Electronics**: Bring your laptop, phone, and adapters (double-check voltage compatibility).
    
-   **Healthcare**: Carry a three-month supply of prescriptions along with your doctor's notes.
    
-   **Personal Items**: Limit keepsakes to fit into two suitcases.
    

For larger moves, compare shipping options through companies like [DHL](https://www.dhl.com/global-en/home.html), [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping.html), or local specialists. Booking 6–8 weeks in advance often helps you lock in better rates [\[4\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/moving-abroad/moving-abroad-checklist.php).

## Getting Started Abroad

### Week 1 Tasks

The first week in a new country is all about settling in and handling key tasks. In many places, registering with local authorities is a must if you want access to services like banking and healthcare.

Here’s a quick timeline to help you prioritize:

| Service | Suggested Timeline |
| --- | --- |
| Local Registration | Days 1–2 |
| Phone/Internet Setup | Days 1–3 |
| Banking Setup | Days 3–5 |
| Utilities Activation | Days 5–7 |

Getting a local phone number should be one of your first steps. Be sure to bring your passport and housing documents - many countries require these to register a SIM card.

Once these basics are handled, shift your focus to building your social and professional network.

### Meeting People

If you’re in a popular spot for digital nomads, there are plenty of ways to meet others. Platforms like Facebook and Reddit have area-specific groups for expats, where you’ll find meetups and tons of local tips [\[7\]](https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/best-countries-digital-nomads).

Consider these options to connect with others:

-   Attend networking events at coworking spaces
    
-   Join local language exchange meetups
    
-   Check out professional workshops
    
-   Use [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) to find groups that match your interests
    

Building these connections early can make your experience much smoother and more enjoyable.

### Daily Life Setup

Balancing work and exploration starts with a good routine. Look into coworking spaces - they often offer not just fast internet but also a built-in community.

Healthcare is another priority. Make sure your health insurance covers you locally and find out where the nearest clinics or hospitals are.

Here are some tips for setting up your daily life:

-   Locate essential spots like grocery stores, pharmacies, and transit stops
    
-   Find backup workspaces in case of internet issues
    
-   Set up automatic payments for rent and utilities
    

You can also tap into local services designed for digital nomads to help you stay organized and compliant with local regulations while keeping your productivity on track.

## Next Steps

### Local Life

Getting involved in local life goes beyond just learning the language. Dive into the culture by attending community events or joining programs at libraries and community centers. These can be great ways to pick up skills like traditional crafts, local cooking techniques, and customs directly from residents.

Feeling homesick? Strike a balance between embracing your new environment and staying in touch with home. Engage in local traditions, take language classes, and join community gatherings, but also make time for regular video calls or virtual hangouts with friends and family.

### Work Growth

Working abroad can offer unique chances to advance professionally. Many coworking spaces host networking events and workshops tailored for international professionals, making them a great resource for skill-building and meeting like-minded people [\[2\]](https://www.thingsnomadsdo.com/blog/checklist-for-digital-nomads-when-arriving-at-a-new-destination).

Tap into platforms like LinkedIn Local for face-to-face networking, join professional associations for industry updates, and connect with the Chamber of Commerce to learn about the local business environment. These efforts can help you understand the market while boosting your career prospects.

### Next Moves

As a digital nomad, planning ahead is key to keeping your lifestyle running smoothly while exploring new opportunities. Many countries now offer visas specifically designed for digital nomads [\[1\]](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/digital-nomad-visa/). To stay on track, make it a habit to:

-   Check visa requirements every six months
    
-   Review your tax obligations yearly
    
-   Reassess your career goals to decide whether to stay or move to a new destination
    

For better financial management, set up international banking through services that provide multi-currency accounts. This makes it easier to handle finances across borders while keeping ties to your home country [\[5\]](https://coliving.com/blog/moving-abroad-checklist-12-must-do-steps-for-expats).
