## Holafly eSIM Basics

### How eSIM Technology Works

An eSIM is a small chip built directly into your device, eliminating the need for a physical SIM card. This technology allows you to switch between mobile plans through software instead of swapping SIM cards.

Since 2017, major device manufacturers have integrated eSIM capability into their products. [Google Pixel](https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US) phones led the way, followed by Apple iPhones in 2018 and [Samsung Galaxy](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/) devices in 2020[\[1\]](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/what-is-an-esim-card). In fact, the latest [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) models (14 and 15 series) in the US now support eSIM exclusively[\[1\]](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/what-is-an-esim-card).

> "Simply put, eSIM lets you change your wireless carrier, data, or service plan through software." - PCMag[\[1\]](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/what-is-an-esim-card)

Newer iPhones can store up to eight eSIM profiles, with two active at the same time[\[1\]](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/what-is-an-esim-card). This feature is especially useful for travelers who want to keep their home number while using local data services abroad.

Holafly takes full advantage of these eSIM capabilities to provide a travel-friendly solution.
