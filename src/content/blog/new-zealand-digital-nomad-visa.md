## Visa Requirements

### Passport and Age Rules

To apply for New Zealand's digital nomad visa, you’ll need a valid passport that remains current for the duration of your stay [\[2\]](https://lost-abroad.com/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa/). While there isn’t a strict age limit, applicants must prove they can work remotely and support themselves financially while in New Zealand. These are the basic criteria, forming the starting point for further evaluations related to work and health.

### Work and Income Requirements

There’s no set minimum income requirement for this visa [\[3\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2025/02/05/digital-nomad-visas-new-zealand-launches-new-long-term-working-visa/)[\[5\]](https://digitalnomads.world/travel/new-zealand-updates-its-visitor-visa-rules-with-no-minimum-income-requirement/). Instead, applicants need to provide evidence of their remote work setup:

-   Proof of remote employment with a foreign employer or documentation showing self-employment with international clients [\[1\]](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa)
    
-   Bank statements demonstrating savings of about NZD 7,000 (approximately US$4,300) [\[2\]](https://lost-abroad.com/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa/)
    
-   Evidence confirming ongoing remote work arrangements
    

> "Many countries offer digital nomad visas and the list is growing, so we need to keep pace to ensure New Zealand is an attractive destination for people who want to 'workcation' abroad", said Tourism Minister Louise Upston [\[1\]](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa).

### Medical and Background Checks

Applicants must meet New Zealand’s health and security guidelines. Health requirements include:

-   Proof of comprehensive health insurance [\[2\]](https://lost-abroad.com/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa/)
    
-   Meeting Immigration New Zealand’s "acceptable standard of health" criteria [\[6\]](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/medical-info/acceptable-standard-of-health-criteria-for-visa-approvals)
    
-   Undergoing a medical examination if requested by immigration officials
    

For background checks, applicants must provide:

-   A recent FBI criminal background check dated within the last six months [\[7\]](https://nomadsembassy.com/criminal-background-check-for-digital-nomad-visa/)
    
-   Apostille-certified documents [\[7\]](https://nomadsembassy.com/criminal-background-check-for-digital-nomad-visa/)
    
-   A clean criminal record from their home country [\[2\]](https://lost-abroad.com/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa/)
    

The FBI background check typically costs around US$18, while apostille certification costs about US$20 per document [\[7\]](https://nomadsembassy.com/criminal-background-check-for-digital-nomad-visa/). Immigration New Zealand may reject applications if the applicant is likely to need hospitalization, residential care, expensive medications, or disability services [\[6\]](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/medical-info/acceptable-standard-of-health-criteria-for-visa-approvals).

## Life as a Digital Nomad in New Zealand

### Living Expenses

The cost of living in New Zealand depends heavily on where you settle. Larger cities like Auckland and Queenstown tend to be pricier, while smaller towns are easier on the wallet. Here's a breakdown of typical monthly expenses:

-   **Housing Costs (Monthly):**
    
    -   **Auckland:** $1,190–$1,450 for a one-bedroom city apartment [\[9\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/living-abroad/costs/new-zealand/)
        
    -   **Wellington:** $1,280–$1,570 for a one-bedroom city apartment [\[9\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/living-abroad/costs/new-zealand/)
        
    -   **Christchurch:** $900–$1,100 for a one-bedroom city apartment [\[9\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/living-abroad/costs/new-zealand/)
        
-   **Daily Expenses:**
    
    -   Groceries: $290–$325 per person
        
    -   Restaurant meal: $26–$39
        
    -   Coffee (flat white): $3.25–$3.90
        
    -   Public transport pass: $115 monthly
        
    -   Basic utilities: $160–$200
        

Food prices have risen by 9.6% from July 2022 to July 2023 [\[8\]](https://www.petrinadarrah.com/posts/cost-of-living-in-new-zealand). A single person should budget around $815–$1,000 per month for essentials, excluding rent. In cities like Auckland, Wellington, and Queenstown, monthly costs can range from $3,500 to $4,000 [\[8\]](https://www.petrinadarrah.com/posts/cost-of-living-in-new-zealand). To manage these expenses, reliable internet is crucial for remote work.

### Internet and Workspace Options

New Zealand offers reliable, high-speed internet thanks to nationwide broadband upgrades. Speeds typically reach 100 Mbps for downloads and 50 Mbps for uploads [\[10\]](https://www.enz.org/getting-an-internet-connection.html).

-   **Internet Service Costs:**
    
    -   Fiber broadband: $70–$100 monthly for unlimited data
        
    -   Mobile broadband: $40 monthly for 60–120GB of data
        
    -   Satellite internet: $135–$200 monthly depending on provider and data plan
        

Coworking spaces are widely available, catering to different needs and budgets:

| Space | Location | Starting Price | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [BizDojo](https://www.bizdojo.com/) | Multiple cities | $399 | Fitness programs, pet-friendly |
| [ARGO Beach](https://www.sharedspace.co.nz/listings/detail/office-space/canterbury/5141/argo-beach-coworking-christchurch.html) | Coastal areas | $480 | Sea views, standing desks |
| [Exchange Christchurch](https://www.xchc.co.nz/) | Christchurch | $299 | Community events |
| [Servcorp](https://www.servcorp.co.nz/en/coworking/) | Major cities | $200 | Premium facilities |

### Money Management

New Zealand's banking system is well-suited for temporary residents, offering mobile apps, international payment options, multi-currency accounts, and travel-friendly credit cards. These tools make managing high living costs easier.

For international money transfers, services like [Wise](https://wise.com/) and [OFX](https://www.ofx.com/en-us/) provide competitive exchange rates. If you're in areas with spotty internet, offline-capable budgeting apps can help you keep track of spending.

Keep in mind that living in New Zealand is not cheap. For example, a single person in Auckland needs at least $1,570 monthly for basic expenses [\[9\]](https://www.internationalcitizens.com/living-abroad/costs/new-zealand/). Make sure to account for both fixed and variable costs when planning your budget.

## Visa Rules and Limits

### Length of Stay

Starting January 27, 2025, the visa allows an initial stay of 90 days, with the option to extend up to nine months. This update is particularly helpful for US visitors who previously had six-month visas[\[3\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2025/02/05/digital-nomad-visas-new-zealand-launches-new-long-term-working-visa/).

### Allowed Activities

This visa has clear restrictions to safeguard the local job market. Here's a breakdown of what you can and cannot do under the digital nomad visa:

| **Permitted Activities** | **Prohibited Activities** |
| --- | --- |
| Remote work for overseas employers | Working for New Zealand companies |
| Serving international clients | Providing services to local businesses |
| Online business management | Physical presence in New Zealand workplaces |
| Virtual meetings and collaboration | Local contract work |

If your work involves New Zealand-based companies, you’ll need a different type of work visa[\[11\]](https://relo.ai/digital-nomad/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa-gives-you-the-freedom-to-roam-and-earn/). For business activities tied to foreign companies in New Zealand, a Business Visitor Visa might be a better fit[\[1\]](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa).

### Tax Rules

Tax obligations are another critical factor for digital nomads in New Zealand. Here's a quick breakdown of the tax thresholds:

-   **Short-term Stay (Under 92 days):** Income earned from overseas employers isn't taxed in New Zealand if it's already taxed in another country[\[3\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2025/02/05/digital-nomad-visas-new-zealand-launches-new-long-term-working-visa/)[\[12\]](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/media-centre/news-notifications/working-remotely-from-new-zealand)[\[14\]](https://www.nexia.co.nz/tax-consequences-digital-nomad-in-nz/).
    
-   **Medium-term Stay (Up to 183 days):** For residents of countries with tax treaties with New Zealand (like the US, UK, and many European nations), taxes apply after 183 days[\[12\]](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/media-centre/news-notifications/working-remotely-from-new-zealand)[\[13\]](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3e01d95e-a21c-4d40-bc02-7ca9ec358448).
    
-   **Long-term Stay (Beyond Thresholds):** If you exceed these periods, you’ll need to:
    
    -   Apply for an IRD number
        
    -   File New Zealand tax returns
        
    -   Pay taxes at rates ranging from 10.5% to 39%[\[14\]](https://www.nexia.co.nz/tax-consequences-digital-nomad-in-nz/)
        

New Zealand has tax treaties with over 40 countries[\[12\]](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/media-centre/news-notifications/working-remotely-from-new-zealand)[\[14\]](https://www.nexia.co.nz/tax-consequences-digital-nomad-in-nz/), which can help avoid double taxation. However, consulting a tax professional is highly recommended to ensure you meet all requirements specific to your situation.

## Making Your Decision

### Main Visa Perks

New Zealand's digital nomad visa stands out with its quick processing time (80% of applications are approved within 3.5 weeks), no minimum income requirement, and an initial 90-day stay for a fee of NZD 341 [\[1\]](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/new-zealand-digital-nomad-visa)[\[3\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2025/02/05/digital-nomad-visas-new-zealand-launches-new-long-term-working-visa/). These features make it an appealing option for remote workers looking to explore New Zealand. Here's how you can prepare for a smooth application process.

### Planning Tips

To make the most of this opportunity, keep these key steps in mind:

-   **Budget Wisely**  
    Make sure you have at least NZD 4,200 (about $2,380) available to cover your stay [\[4\]](https://citizenremote.com/visas/new-zealand/).
    
-   **Organize Your Documents**  
    Check that your passport is valid for at least 15 months from your application date [\[4\]](https://citizenremote.com/visas/new-zealand/).
    
-   **Choose the Right Timing**  
    Consider applying during New Zealand's shoulder season. This period often offers better accommodation rates and less competition for resources.
    

Additionally, explore other options like the Working Holiday Visa, which allows stays of up to 23 months for certain nationalities. For tailored advice, consult an immigration professional [\[4\]](https://citizenremote.com/visas/new-zealand/).
