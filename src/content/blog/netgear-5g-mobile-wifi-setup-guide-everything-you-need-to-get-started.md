## Performance Tips

Once your network is set up, follow these steps to get the best performance from your device.

### WiFi Band Selection

Your Netgear 5G Mobile WiFi device supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, each suited for different needs. The **2.4 GHz band** is ideal for IoT devices, email, and light browsing. It offers a range of 150 ft indoors and 300 ft outdoors, with speeds up to 10 Mbps. On the other hand, the **5 GHz band** is perfect for gaming, streaming, and video calls. It has a shorter range - 75 ft indoors and 150 ft outdoors - but delivers much faster speeds, up to 250 Mbps.

For faster internet, stick to the 5 GHz band. Kevin Parrish from [HighSpeedInternet.com](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/) explains its advantages [\[3\]](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/2-4-ghz-vs-5-ghz-wi-fi):

> "The 5 GHz band is the connection to use. Modern routers overcome the band's range shortfalls by amplifying the signals, so I can get a 250Mbps reading standing across the street at 120 feet. I barely get any speed reading using the 2.4 GHz band in the same spot."
