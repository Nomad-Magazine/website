GetCroissant provides access to workspaces designed for productivity and professionalism.

> "Coworking spaces blend the freedom of remote work with the structure, motivation, and community of an office." [\[1\]](https://www.linkedin.com/company/croissant)

For example, Dipak Vadera chose [XCHG Spaces](https://xchgspaces.co.uk/) in London for meetings, while Caroline Dépierre and Thomas Vie utilized [Monday Working Spaces](https://mymonday.es/en/ciudades/barcelona) in Barcelona for strategic planning [\[1\]](https://www.linkedin.com/company/croissant). These locations not only offer a productive atmosphere but also open doors to meaningful professional connections.

### Networking Options

The platform also supports networking by connecting professionals in community-oriented spaces.

> "Croissant allows me to cowork around the city based on my mood and that is something that traditional coworking memberships fall short of." [\[5\]](https://rosisellers.medium.com/get-croissant-the-app-thats-changing-the-coworking-game-f69b8bd9a59e)

This feedback underscores how these spaces encourage both professional networking and social engagement.
