Then, check out the details about each spot's setup and atmosphere to make sure it suits your work style.

### Internet and Environment Check

Once you’ve filtered your options, dig into the specifics of each cafe’s internet and environment. Workfrom provides detailed information about connectivity, including:

| Feature | What to Check |
| --- | --- |
| Wi‑Fi Speed | Look at both download and upload speeds (in Mbps). |

You can also read member reviews to get insights into noise levels, seating comfort, and overall ambiance. After confirming the internet and vibe are up to your standards, double-check for other workspace essentials.

### Required Workspace Features

In addition to internet and ambiance, certain amenities are key for a productive workday. Workfrom’s listings highlight these important features:

If cafes aren't cutting it, coworking spaces might be the solution. Platforms like Workfrom can help you find spaces tailored to your needs. You can filter options based on amenities and location while accessing detailed information like photos, internet speeds, and user reviews to make a well-informed decision.

## Work Productivity Tips

### Mobile Office Setup

Set up your mobile workspace with the tools you need for a productive day. Position yourself near windows to take advantage of natural light, which can help improve focus and reduce stress. Arrange your workstation to prioritize both comfort and efficiency.

### Focus and Concentration

Once your workspace is ready, it’s time to hone in on staying productive. Jewel Mlnarik, Maker of Workfrom, highlights:

> "One consistent environmental factor helps everyone maximize their ability to get into and stay in flow: zero distractions" [\[2\]](https://workfrom.co/magazine/story/working-remote-tips-to-boost-your-productivity)

Here are a few ways to minimize distractions and stay in the zone:

-   Pick a spot away from busy areas
-   Use separate browsers for work and personal browsing
-   Schedule communication checks during breaks
-   Turn on "Do Not Disturb" on your devices
-   Play instrumental music to create a focused atmosphere

After optimizing your focus, the next step is ensuring your connection is secure.

### Public Wi-Fi Security

When using public Wi-Fi, protecting your data is crucial. Follow these security tips to safeguard your information:

| Security Measure | How to Implement | Why It’s Important |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use a VPN | Turn it on before connecting | Encrypts all internet activity |
| Verify the Network | Confirm the name with staff | Avoids connecting to fake hotspots |
| Adjust Device Settings | Disable file sharing and auto-connect | Reduces risks of unauthorized access |
| Enable 2FA | Activate two-factor authentication | Adds an extra layer of security |
| Check for HTTPS | Look for "https://" in URLs | Ensures encrypted connections |

Always update your operating system and apps with the latest security patches. For even better protection, use your mobile device as a hotspot instead of relying on public Wi-Fi [\[3\]](https://workfrom.co/magazine/story/stay-safe-working-public-wifi). Lastly, secure your equipment with a laptop lock and stay alert to prevent "shoulder surfing."

## Community Engagement

Once you've set up a productive workspace, connecting with others can take your remote work experience to the next level.

### Professional Connections

Workfrom also offers body doubling sessions, where members are paired to keep each other accountable. This setup mimics the feel of in-person coworking, with 87% of participants noting improved focus and engagement [\[4\]](https://www.workfrom.com/).
