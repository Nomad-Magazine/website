## How to Pick Your 5G Mobile WiFi

### Key Selection Criteria

When choosing a 5G mobile WiFi device, focus on three main factors: network compatibility, battery life, and temperature range. First, ensure the device works with the networks at your destinations. For battery life, look for models that last at least 13 hours - devices like the Huawei Pro offer 16 hours, outlasting [Netgear](https://www.netgear.com/)'s 13-hour runtime. Temperature range is also critical. The Huawei Pro operates between –4°F and 104°F, while [Netgear](https://www.netgear.com/) handles a broader range of –22°F to 140°F. These factors are essential for selecting a device that suits your travel or work needs.

| Feature | Minimum Requirements | Advanced Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network Support | 5G NSA/SA dual-mode | Global roaming in 130+ countries |
| Battery Life | 13 hours of continuous use | 16+ hours of continuous use |
| Security | WPA3 encryption | VPN passthrough, guest network isolation |

### Best Options by User Type

Different devices cater to different user needs. Here's how to match the right device to your lifestyle:

-   **Frequent Train Commuters**: The Huawei Pro is ideal for those traveling at high speeds. Its AI signal optimization ensures stable connections even at speeds over 150 mph, making it perfect for uninterrupted video calls during long train rides.
    
-   **International Business Travelers**: If you need global coverage, look for features like global SIM compatibility or dual-SIM options. The Huawei Pro, priced at $549, offers these features at a competitive rate compared to pricier alternatives.
    
-   **Budget-Conscious Users**: For reliable U.S. coverage at a lower cost, the Huawei E6878-870 is a solid choice at $299. Pairing it with T‑Mobile's "Network Pass" program can save you $50–$100 on device costs.
    

A 2024 study by [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/) revealed that touchscreen interfaces, like the Huawei Pro's 2.4-inch screen, can cut setup time by 40% compared to older LED indicator systems.

-   **Remote Workers**: If you need to connect multiple devices, pay attention to the maximum connection limits:

| Device Model | Max Connections | Best For | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Huawei Pro | 32 devices | Team collaborators | $549 |
| TP‑Link M7000 | 16 devices | Moderate connectivity needs | $449 |

For tasks like video conferencing, plan for about 50 GB of data per month, while basic tasks require around 5 GB. If you're traveling internationally, opt for a device that supports local SIM cards to avoid high roaming fees - especially if you're using U.S. carriers like T‑Mobile or AT&T.
