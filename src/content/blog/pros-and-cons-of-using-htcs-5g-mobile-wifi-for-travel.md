**Looking for a travel-friendly WiFi solution?** The [HTC 5G Hub](https://www.androidauthority.com/htc-5g-hub-959200/) combines 5G speeds, Android functionality, and the ability to connect up to 20 devices.

If you need a portable workspace with high-speed internet, the [HTC](https://www.htc.com/us/?srsltid=AfmBOorMEIPBgSPA8p6U4UP9dz3-E-hnNqMwR8I3v6WnqhlCERBCBSJp) 5G Hub is a solid option - just keep its size, coverage, and cost in mind.

## Device Specs and Performance

Powered by the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 855, this device delivers download speeds of up to 2.63 Gbps and upload speeds of 287 Mbps [\[1\]](https://www.htc.com/us/5g/htc-5g-hub). That means smooth video calls, seamless 4K streaming, and quick large file transfers without delays.

| Feature | Specification | Travel Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network Support | 5G NR, 4G LTE | Keeps you connected in multiple regions |
| Battery Life | 7,660 mAh | Provides 32 hours of continuous 4G audio use [\[4\]](https://pcmag.com/reviews/htc-5g-hub-sprint) |
| Ports | USB-C 3.1, Gigabit Ethernet | Offers versatile connectivity |
| Wireless Standards | Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ad, Bluetooth 5.0 | Works with most modern devices |

The device balances portability with functionality. Its compact size (5.1 x 3.9 x 1.7 inches) makes it easy to carry, though its 12-ounce (340g) weight is heavier than standard mobile hotspots [\[3\]](https://4gltemall.com/blog/tag/htc-5g-hub-specifications). This extra weight isn’t wasted - it houses a 5-inch HD touchscreen and a large battery, reducing the need for additional gadgets.

For business travelers, the ability to connect up to 20 devices simultaneously is a game-changer [\[1\]](https://www.htc.com/us/5g/htc-5g-hub). Whether it’s for team meetings or collaborative work, this feature ensures everyone stays connected. Plus, built-in VPN support provides secure connections for handling sensitive tasks [\[1\]](https://www.htc.com/us/5g/htc-5g-hub).

The device also comes with advanced capabilities. Running on [Android 9 Pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Pie), it supports direct streaming from popular platforms. The USB-C port with DisplayPort compatibility makes connecting to external displays simple, while the microSD slot offers extra storage, which is especially useful in areas with limited cloud access [\[1\]](https://www.htc.com/us/5g/htc-5g-hub).

## Benefits and Limitations

The HTC 5G Mobile WiFi has both strengths and weaknesses that travelers should weigh carefully. Here's a closer look at how it performs in real-world situations.

Testing showed LTE speeds reaching 308 Mbps for downloads and 80 Mbps for uploads, alongside a low latency of just 17 milliseconds [\[5\]](https://4gltemall.com/blog/tag/htc-5g-hub-review). These numbers make it a strong option for remote work and staying productive while traveling.

> "HTC is proud to bring to market the world's first 5G mobile smart hub. 5G will be the game-changer for VR and AR, and the new HTC 5G Hub will seamlessly deliver the great bandwidth of 5G to our devices, driving our vision of Vive Reality - a boundless, immersive environment where human experiences will come to the forefront." - Cher Wang, Chairwoman and CEO of HTC [\[2\]](https://geardiary.com/2019/02/27/htc-5g-mobile-smart-hub-mwc-2019-announcement)

However, some drawbacks can't be ignored. Data plan limitations may frustrate users who stream or download large files frequently. Additionally, its size makes it less portable compared to smaller, more pocket-friendly hotspots [\[4\]](https://pcmag.com/reviews/htc-5g-hub-sprint).

The device does offer corporate VPN configuration for secure connections and dual speakers with a 90dB output for entertainment. But at $600 MSRP [\[4\]](https://pcmag.com/reviews/htc-5g-hub-sprint), it's a pricey option. Travelers should consider how often they need high-speed connectivity and whether the features justify the cost.

## Final Assessment

The HTC 5G Hub provides a mix of advantages and challenges for travelers, especially digital nomads. Its highlights include a long-lasting battery and the ability to connect multiple devices. Powered by Android 9.0 and featuring a 5-inch display, it goes beyond standard mobile hotspots, offering tools for both entertainment and work.

However, practical factors like its larger size and higher price can make it less convenient for those prioritizing portability.

> "The HTC 5G Hub is a product for a business that Sprint isn't quite yet willing to commit to. It's a great device to let you cast off your home or business ISP, to use at a country house, or to set up an office anywhere. However, Sprint's limited 5G coverage so far, and its capped data plans, don't quite offer an alternative to wired internet." - Sascha Segan, Former Lead Analyst, Mobile, PCMag.com [\[4\]](https://pcmag.com/reviews/htc-5g-hub-sprint)

For digital nomads, the device offers clear strengths but also some limitations:

**Advantages**:

-   Secure connections, including corporate VPN and Ethernet support
-   High-quality multimedia options, such as 4K streaming
-   Flexibility of the Android platform for productivity tools

**Drawbacks**:

-   Monthly data caps can restrict usage
-   Limited 5G coverage may reduce performance
-   No option for external antennas

The HTC 5G Hub is best suited for setting up temporary workspaces or for longer stays in one location, rather than constant travel. Its features cater well to remote work needs, as long as its size and price fit the user's priorities.

## FAQs

### How well does the HTC 5G Hub perform in areas with limited 5G coverage?

The performance of the HTC 5G Hub in areas with limited 5G coverage largely depends on the availability and strength of fallback networks like 4G LTE.
