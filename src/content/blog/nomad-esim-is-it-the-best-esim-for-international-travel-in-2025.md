![Airalo](https://assets.seobotai.com/nomadgossip.com/67d9f31f31389773b3fed47d/81b10a9f668120295d0796c6a8c402d5.jpg)

Airalo is making travel connectivity simpler with its wide coverage and affordable data plans.

### Network Coverage and Performance

Airalo works with leading carriers in **199 countries** [\[5\]](https://halfdigitalnomad.com/airalo-esim/). In the U.S., it connects through **AT&T** and **[T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/)**, while in the U.K., it uses **[Telefonica O2](https://www.o2.co.uk/)** [\[4\]](https://www.aworldinreach.com/airalo-esim-review/). With over **10 million users globally** [\[6\]](https://www.airalo.com/), the network's performance depends on the location - some areas provide **5G speeds**, while others may only support **3G** [\[5\]](https://halfdigitalnomad.com/airalo-esim/). Be sure to check the available speeds for your destination before committing to a plan.

### Data Plan Pricing

Airalo’s plans cater to a variety of travel needs:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local eSIMs | $5  | 1GB | For single countries |
| Regional Plans | $15 | 5GB | Covers multiple areas |
| Global Plans | $50 | Up to unlimited | Worldwide connectivity |

For example, a traveler in Ireland used a **$15 Airalo plan** for a week - saving significantly compared to a **$35 carrier charge** for less than 500 MB of daily high-speed data [\[7\]](https://kendyltravels.com/airalo-esim-review/). Plus, the setup process is designed to be quick and hassle-free.

### Setup Process

    Scan a QR code and follow the steps. Check the activation policy for your eSIM beforehand [\[8\]](https://www.airalo.com/blog/how-does-airalo-work).

## 3\. [Holafly](https://esim.holafly.com/) eSIM Overview

Holafly stands out with its unlimited data plans and easy activation process. Since 2017, it has served over 1 million customers and offers coverage in more than 160 countries [\[9\]](https://www.monito.com/en/review/holafly).

### Network Coverage and Performance

Holafly partners with local carriers to provide reliable 3G/4G LTE service, with 5G available in many areas. Their service quality is backed by a 4.7-star rating from around 35,000 Trustpilot reviews [\[9\]](https://www.monito.com/en/review/holafly).

| Region | Coverage Details | Starting Price (5 days) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Europe | 40+ countries | ~$19 |
| Asia | Includes destinations like Japan, India | ~$19–$29 |

### Data Plan Pricing

Holafly's pricing aligns with its broad global coverage. For example, in the US, a 5-day plan costs $19, a 15-day plan is $47, and a 60-day plan is $87. Similar pricing tiers apply for countries like the UK and Japan [\[9\]](https://www.monito.com/en/review/holafly).

### Setup Process and Usage

Activating a Holafly eSIM is simple: scan the QR code sent to your email. If you encounter issues, detailed device-specific guides are provided.

> "The instructions were super easy to follow and I had no problems with the service for the whole 20 days that I used it. It was nice not to worry about how much my phone company was going to charge me for service abroad."  
> – Karen Christensen, Verified buyer [\[10\]](https://esim.holafly.com/holafly-reviews/)

However, there are some limitations to keep in mind. Hotspotting and tethering may not work in many countries, fair usage policies could affect speeds, and activation should be done only after arriving at your destination.

In July 2024, traveler Milet Miranda highlighted Holafly's dependability by maintaining steady 4G connectivity in remote areas of Finnish Lapland and Iceland, even when users of other services faced signal issues [\[10\]](https://esim.holafly.com/holafly-reviews/).

## Key Differences Between Providers

Meanwhile, Airalo recorded speeds of 181 Mbps in Dubai and 112 Mbps in Vietnam[\[1\]](https://travelesimexpert.com/airalo-vs-nomad/). These results provide a clear basis for comparing their network performance, pricing, and standout features.

While Airalo is competitive for smaller data packages, Nomad provides more savings for higher-volume plans. Here's a comparison of 5GB plan pricing across a few destinations:

## Final Verdict

Nomad eSIM has proven to be a dependable option for international travelers, backed by feedback from 2025 users and a solid 4.7/5.0 average rating from over 12,000 reviews [\[12\]](https://www.getnomad.app/global-eSIM). With coverage spanning more than 170 countries, it offers reliable connectivity that meets the needs of modern travelers. Let’s break down its pricing and technical performance.

Nomad stands out for its cost-effective options, especially for extended trips and larger data plans. Regional plans start at $1.44/GB, while global plans are priced at $7.20/GB [\[14\]](https://www.getnomad.app/hong-kong-eSIM?rfsn=7432846.e5d9a4). Current deals, like a 30-day global plan with 3GB for $26, make it even more appealing.

From a technical perspective, Nomad is both reliable and easy to use. An expert review highlighted its strengths:

> "One of, if not the best travel eSIM provider available right now. We have been impressed with Nomad's signal strength, pricing and ease of use." [\[1\]](https://travelesimexpert.com/airalo-vs-nomad/)

However, no product is without its drawbacks. While the app is visually appealing, its navigation can feel slower compared to other options. Additionally, global plans cover 106–113 countries [\[13\]](https://www.getnomad.app/shop), which may require users to purchase regional plans for complete worldwide coverage.

For digital nomads and frequent travelers, Nomad eSIM offers a strong combination of dependable connectivity, competitive pricing, and a user-friendly interface. Its flexible data options and multi-network support make it a practical solution for staying connected on the go.
