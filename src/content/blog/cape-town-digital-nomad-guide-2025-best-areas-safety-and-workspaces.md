### 2025 Visa Information

South Africa launched its Digital Nomad Visa on May 20, 2024. This visa lets remote workers live in Cape Town for up to 36 months, with the option to renew [\[7\]](https://citizenremote.com/visas/south-africa-digital-nomad-visa/).

To qualify, you'll need:

-   **Annual income**: $37,500 (R650,976)
-   **Valid passport**
-   **Proof of remote work**
-   **Health insurance**
-   **Criminal background check**
-   **Accommodation details**

Citizens from the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand can enter South Africa visa-free for up to 90 days. If you plan to stay longer, you'll need to apply for the Digital Nomad Visa from your home country. Processing typically takes 2–4 months [\[7\]](https://citizenremote.com/visas/south-africa-digital-nomad-visa/).

### Tax Guidelines

If you're staying in Cape Town, understanding your tax responsibilities is crucial. South Africa operates under a residence-based tax system, with specific rules for remote workers [\[8\]](https://www.sars.gov.za/individuals/tax-during-all-life-stages-and-events/tax-and-non-residents/).

| **Stay Duration** | **Tax Obligations** | **Requirements** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Less than 6 months | May qualify for tax exemption | Must apply for exemption |
| More than 6 months (in 36 months) | Must register with SARS | Full tax compliance required |
| Over 183 days (in 12 months) | Considered tax resident | Worldwide income becomes taxable |

For US citizens, the Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) between South Africa and the United States is important. To avoid South African taxes:

-   Limit your stay to less than 183 days in a 12-month period.
-   Ensure you're paid by a non-South African employer.
-   Confirm your employer has no permanent establishment in South Africa [\[8\]](https://www.sars.gov.za/individuals/tax-during-all-life-stages-and-events/tax-and-non-residents/).

### Medical Coverage Needs

Health insurance is a must for the Digital Nomad Visa [\[9\]](https://www.ibn.co.za/south-africa/digital-nomad-visa/). Your coverage should include:

-   **Comprehensive medical insurance** valid in South Africa
-   **Emergency medical evacuation**
-   **Repatriation coverage**

Additionally, you'll need a medical certificate confirming you're in good health [\[9\]](https://www.ibn.co.za/south-africa/digital-nomad-visa/).
