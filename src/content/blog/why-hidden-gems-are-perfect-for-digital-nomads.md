## 5 Advantages of Lesser-Known Locations

Choosing lesser-known destinations comes with more than just cost savings - it offers practical perks for digital nomads looking for a balanced lifestyle.

### Lower Living Costs

Opting for hidden gems can significantly reduce your expenses compared to major cities. For example, while living in places like Singapore or Sydney might cost over $5,000 a month, emerging destinations provide similar amenities at a much lower price [\[2\]](https://abrotherabroad.com/cheapest-cities-to-live-in-the-world).

Here’s a snapshot of monthly costs in some up-and-coming nomad hotspots:

| City | Monthly Cost | Highlights |

| Hanoi, Vietnam | $1,063 | Blend of rich traditions and modern living |
| Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina | $1,207 | Historic landmarks, cozy cafe culture |

These lower costs make it easier to maintain the lifestyle many digital nomads aspire to.

### Better Work-Life Balance

Smaller, quieter destinations often promote a healthier work-life balance. With fewer distractions and a slower pace, they’re ideal for digital nomads who want to escape the hustle of crowded hubs. The rise in digital nomads - from 11 million in 2020 to 15.5 million in 2021 [\[4\]](https://freakingnomads.com/where-to-live-as-a-digital-nomad-for-less-than-1500-per-month/) - has led many to seek these peaceful alternatives.

These advantages make lesser-known locations a compelling choice for those seeking more than just a place to work remotely.
