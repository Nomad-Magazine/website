## Tips to Improve Performance

Get the most out of your Alcatel 5G Mobile WiFi by fine-tuning its placement and settings.

### Best Places to Put Your Device

Where you position your device can make a big difference in performance. Aim for a spot with a clear line of sight to your connected devices. In offices or coworking spaces, place it on a raised, central surface, away from large metal objects and anything that could cause electronic interference. If you're in a hotel room or another temporary setup, try placing it near a window or a central location.

**Placement pointers:**

-   Keep a clear line of sight to connected devices.
-   Avoid areas with large metal surfaces or heavy interference.
-   Place the device on an elevated, central surface.

Once you've nailed the placement, fine-tune your connection by adjusting the Wi-Fi band settings.

### Using 2.4GHz and 5GHz Bands

The Alcatel 5G Mobile WiFi supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, letting you choose the best option based on your environment. Each band has its strengths, so picking the right one can boost your network's performance.

| Band | Best For | Ideal Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.4 GHz | Longer range and better wall coverage | Larger spaces or areas with obstructions |
| 5 GHz | Faster speeds and less interference | Open, crowded areas like coffee shops |

For crowded places with lots of competing networks, like a coworking space, the 5 GHz band is your best bet. On the other hand, if you're dealing with thick walls or need a broader range, the 2.4 GHz band is the way to go.

### Updates and Data Tracking

Keep your device running smoothly by regularly updating its firmware and monitoring usage through the web interface.

**How to update firmware:**

1.  Open the web management portal in your browser.
2.  Go to **Settings > Administration > Firmware Update**.
3.  Install updates during non-essential work hours to avoid disruptions.

The web interface is also a handy tool for tracking data usage and ensuring you're making the most of your connection. Regular updates and monitoring can help avoid any unexpected issues.
