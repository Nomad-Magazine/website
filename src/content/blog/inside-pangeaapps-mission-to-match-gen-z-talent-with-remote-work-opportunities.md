## Gen Z and Remote Work Today

Gen Z's arrival in the workforce has brought noticeable changes to remote work norms. Research shows they switch jobs 134% more often now compared to 2019 [\[5\]](https://www.axios.com/2022/02/25/gen-z-great-resignation-generation-job-hopping).

### Why Gen Z Prefers Remote Work

Remote work fits well with a generation raised on technology and a strong desire for independence. According to LinkedIn, Gen Z professionals are 77% more likely to interact with job listings that highlight "flexibility" [\[5\]](https://www.axios.com/2022/02/25/gen-z-great-resignation-generation-job-hopping).

> "The employers need to think about how they create ... mentorship and connection that will really keep Gen Zs in place. Because they are likely to move around." - Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn [\[5\]](https://www.axios.com/2022/02/25/gen-z-great-resignation-generation-job-hopping)

When it comes to workplace priorities, Gen Z stands out:

-   **75% are open to changing career paths entirely**
-   **25% plan to leave their current employer within six months**
-   They place high importance on meaningful work and a positive company culture [\[5\]](https://www.axios.com/2022/02/25/gen-z-great-resignation-generation-job-hopping).

While they bring fresh perspectives, they also face notable obstacles.

### Challenges in the Job Search

Even with their tech skills, Gen Z encounters specific hurdles in remote work settings:

**Productivity & Well-Being**

-   43% report lower productivity levels
-   60% of those aged 18-25 struggle with remote work
-   25% experience pay cuts, and 45% see reduced work hours [\[6\]](https://www.pynhq.com/blog/how-different-generations-feel-about-remote-work/)

**Career Growth Concerns**

-   77% of 18-24-year-olds worry remote work limits their career advancement [\[4\]](https://www.meet-eric.com/blog/is-gen-z-ready-to-ditch-the-office)
-   37% miss having a dedicated office space, compared to 25.6% of millennials [\[6\]](https://www.pynhq.com/blog/how-different-generations-feel-about-remote-work/)
-   Gen Z faces more work-related burnout than other age groups [\[6\]](https://www.pynhq.com/blog/how-different-generations-feel-about-remote-work/)

These findings highlight the need for strong support systems to help Gen Z navigate the challenges of remote work and succeed in virtual roles.
