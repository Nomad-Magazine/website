    text: "Nomad Magazine is like having that well-traveled, fascinating friend who always knows the best places to go, how to settle in, and how to avoid common expat headaches—whether it's picking the right health insurance or figuring out the dating scene in a new country. The magazine saves me hours of searching online, wrapping up useful tips in a design so beautiful, I actually want to hold it in my hands. In a world where everything is digital, Nomad reminds me that the most thrilling journeys — and the most captivating stories—are still best enjoyed offline. Don't just read about the nomad life—live it, and take this gem along for the ride!",

Not just all the fluff and IG gloss - but what really makes this community and it's members special. The true behind the scenes that tells a story - one of adventure, discovery, and success through many trial & errors. Her vision and approach to storytelling is inspiring, and I look forward to many more nomad magazine issues and newsletters to come.",
