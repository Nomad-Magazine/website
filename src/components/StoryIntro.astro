        People often ask me why I started this magazine‚Äîand why, in a digital world, I chose print.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The truth is, I've been dreaming of creating a media platform that would serve digital nomads and its industry for nearly a decade. Since 2015, I've watched this lifestyle explode‚Äînew communities, new tools, new ways of living and working. And thought that if cannabis can have its own magazine, why not us?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But there was one little problem: I had no idea how or where to start. I‚Äôd never worked in publishing.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So I started experimenting. I launched a Russian-speaking podcast called NoOfficeAnymore and ran a small website and Instagram page called WhatsUpNomads. But when I took a new job, I didn‚Äôt have the capacity to continue. Still, the idea of a nomad magazine kept looping in my head.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In 2023, I was on Nomad Cruise and saw a pitch program for startup ideas. Just for fun‚Äîand out of curiosity‚ÄîI applied to present the magazine. I wanted to hear what others thought.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-400">
        That moment changed everything.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="https://curves.digital/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-gray-300">Curves.Digital</a> offered to help with branding and landing page (our logo is their creation!). Olga Isaeva from <a href="https://nomadtrain.co/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-gray-300">Nomad Train</a> gave early advice and contacts. My sister introduced me to <a href="https://thewhiteeditorial.com/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-gray-300">Amy White</a>, a senior editor from the Mindvalley circle, who became our editorial guide. Others helped me connect with magazine founders, sharing their experience and encouragement.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I had already spent years immersed in the digital nomad world. I knew many people from the industry‚Äîfounders of events, leaders of communities‚Äîand I felt that these connections could truly make a difference.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So I started pitching the idea to friends, and their support was incredible. Some of the first people to join as writers came directly from the Nomad Cruise community. Their belief in the project gave me the courage to take the next step.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I was introduced to Tatiana Illarionova, who became my first publishing coach and eventually connected me with her trusted art director and designer from Slovakia, who did an amazing job putting the first edition together from scratch.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Still, the first edition was brutal.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It was hard, expensive, and emotionally draining. I felt like I was pushing this thing uphill alone‚Äîwithout knowing if anyone even wanted it. I made myself a promise: I won't give up. No matter what it costs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Eventually, Feride Mustafaieva joined me in December 2023 as the first team member and took over Instagram, YouTube, and our visual identity to life. We launched the first edition on February 11, 2024‚Äîmy birthday (because why not?). The print copies arrived in March. By then, I was fully burned out, juggling a full-time job, a new baby, my magazine. But every message, every sale, every kind word about the magazine gave me another spark to keep going.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        During our second edition, the workload was overwhelming‚Äîuntil Jessica came in like a superhero. She quickly became our senior writer and editor, eventually taking over all communication with authors.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The second edition was very delayed but finally came out in print in January. And what I noticed was this: does not metter how many times people saw digital version, everything changes when people can hold the printed magazine in their hands. That's when the real feedback, orders, and attention start flowing.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The third edition was our smoothest yet. Jess handled the editorial team, we found an amazing design team in Brazil, <a href="https://www.estudiodrama.com.br/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-gray-300">Est√∫dio Drama</a>, and we launched the issue at Bansko Nomad Fest‚Äîthe biggest nomad event in Europe. In time!

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 italic mt-4">
        Oh, one more thing‚Äîsomewhere between being overworked, burned out, and launching the first and second editions, I somehow met Martin Donadieu (the French guy on the right). Fell in love instantly, we got married eight months after we met‚Äîour online wedding story is featured in the third edition. He became the unofficial co-founder as our CTO and my entrepreneurial mentor. When the magazine financially succeeds, it will be thanks to my team, Martin‚Ä¶ and maybe a little bit to me too.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mt-12 mb-6">Now, you might be wondering: who pays for all this? Does the magazine make money?</h3>
      
      <p>
        Short answer: I'm the solo founder and also the solo investor. I still keep the full-time job and my salary doesn't go to new shoes‚Äîit goes to making sure the magazine is sustainable. Each edition (we print twice a year) costs around ‚Ç¨25,000, and monthly running costs are ‚Ç¨3,000‚Äì4,000. To give you a brief idea t put together content into the magazine:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
        <li>Design: ‚Ç¨2,500</li>
        <li>Custom cover: ‚Ç¨400</li>
        <li>Final round of roofreading: ‚Ç¨700‚Äì1,000</li>
        <li>Print 1000 copies: ‚Ç¨3,200</li>
        <li>Shipping (events, coworkings, colivings): ‚Ç¨2,500</li>
        <li>Plus: Team salaries, YouTube episodes, tools, subscriptions, event sponsorship, custom illustrations, marketing‚Ä¶</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>

      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mt-12 mb-6">So what's next?</h3>
      
      <p>
        We're now focusing on two big goals to secure the 4th edition (which is almost done):
      </p>
      
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
        <li>Applying for EU media grants</li>
        <li>Searching for one main sponsor‚Äî"Powered by‚Ä¶" on the cover, a double-page feature inside, and strategic delivery to key locations for their brand.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        For now, we're proud of what we've done. Three beautifully crafted editions. A growing community. And a bold idea brought to life.
      </p>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
          If you believe in what we're building, the best way to support us is simple:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
          <li>üóûÔ∏è <a href="/editions" class="text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300 underline">Buy the magazine</a></li>
          <li>‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="/support-the-magazine" class="text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300 underline">Become a supporter</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-medium">
          Let's keep printing what matters.
